# Heads up for people wanting suica

I was able to get mine at the Shibuya Jr east travel center yesterday. Very easy. Just gave money and was given a sheet with the rules done. No form.

If you are looking at various stations I say go ask the travel center directly ignoring signs and others . I asked the day before in Shinjuku or ikabukuro and they said no to me at the subway gates said sold out but read elsewhere that people got theirs that day and to go straight to travel centers.


Tldr go to travel center and its easy

There's been a notice on JR's English website since December that regular suica is now purchasable at most of the major stations (ie: Tokyo, Shijuku, Shibuya, Shinagawa). You can buy them at the travel centers.

if you have iphone dont want a some physicsl card as a memory token then highly recommend you just download the suica card app from the apple store and add it to your apple wallet snd link one of your credit/debit cards to it and just load it money as you need it.  and at the train gate just tap your iphone to the touch pad to pay to enter.  also,  the money added is treated as a purchasse so no need to worry as a cash advance fee on your card.  so much conveniet then to carry around a physical card or worrying about finding a place to loading money to it.  currrtnly the suica app only available for iphones and Pasmo does not one for apple oe android

Can I load my digital Suica card with cash at convenience stores?

### Comment 4

I have an android phone.... so I'm assuming I can't download it.

I got the passmo passport for free in Shinjuku station just a few days ago. You just need to turn up with your passport
