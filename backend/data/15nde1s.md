# Ghibli Museum Ticket Reservation Tips 2023

The Ghibli Museum is one of the hottest and most in-demand attractions in Tokyo - The tickets are booked well in advance and sell out over a VERY short window. Here is my experience and also some tips to help others get tickets:

&#x200B;

1. The ticket sale opens for the SUBSEQUENT month, on the 10th of the current month, at 10AM JST. For example, the slots for September 2023 opened on 10 August 2023. Unfortunately for me, 10AM JST is 3AM in Europe ðŸ˜­ Set your alarms and **DO NOT sleep on it ** as you will miss out!
2. There is a separate booking site for foreigners with a massive queue. I logged in at 3AM on the dot and was 8000th in line (FML). I had to wait for 1.5h in the queue to get to the booking area.  The website is [https://l-tike.com/st1/ghibli-en](https://l-tike.com/st1/ghibli-en)
   1. Funnily enough, there is a booking site for residents of Japan which had NO queue. With a VPN and Google Translate I was able to get till the payment page. Unfortunately for me, it did not accept my French bank card so I had no choice but to wait. If you are based in Japan, this is a no-brainer. The JP website is [https://www.ghibli-museum.jp/ticket/](https://www.ghibli-museum.jp/ticket/)
3. Once I got to the booking area, I had 10 mins to make the booking. I saw that 80% of the slots were already sold out.  Luckily there were a few slots remaining on my Tokyo dates and managed to get my tickets. Off to bed!
4. Out of curiosity, I had a look at the slots once I woke up a few hours later, and EVERYTHING was sold out.

Good luck!

Itâ€™s no guarantee, but if you log in 5-10mins before the official start time, you have a better chance

Yeah, the museum seems to be closed on Tuesday every week. So watch out for that.

I went through the Japanese site using VPN and Google translate. I was still able to get tickets today using a US credit card and there was still a lot of availability on the Japan site.  There are some guides posted on other threads for how to do this and it was pretty straight forward. You just need to pick it up from a machine when you're in Japan.

I managed to score some when they went on sale yesterday, but was a little annoyed by the process.

I opened the Lawson site about an hour beforehand, and was able to keep clicking my desired date until it finally changed from "Not for sale yet" to "Available" at 10am, but then it kicked me into a queue behind 12k people once I got to the payment screen.

Fortunately my wife also opened the Lawson site about 20 minutes before it opened up, and got into the queue around the 5k mark. We ended up getting tickets for the day we wanted, but everything before noon was already sold out.

It seems there's a sweet spot about 30 minutes before they go on sale where you can enter the queue early. Before that you will just get the normal Lawson site.
