# Feeling dumb for feeling depressed being back in the USA

Anyone else feel semi depressed once coming back from Japan? I feel like my brains being over dramatic but also just really sad to be home :/

It's tough, there's a drop in feel good chemicals after a trip, and I think jet lag can exacerbate it. I love my life but can certainly feel down after returning from Japan, what's been most helpful for me is going straight back to work/my routine to beat jetlag and avoid too much time daydreaming in bed/being on my phone. I try to schedule fun stuff close to my return. That may be a luxury and not available to everyone though. Journaling/putting together photos from the trip can be a nice way to still feel connected, and of course there's always the option of planning the next trip...

Oh and USA specific -- I think it's hard to come back to the US when you've had recent experience with the safety & ease of Japan. But I do remind myself that visiting as a tourist is entirely different than living there -- as a tourist you get to skip most of the downsides, so it's an unbalanced picture.

I feel a little sad coming home from any vacation because it means I have to go back to my normal life. Can't just drink champagne every meal or spend days not worrying about customer issues, debugging problems, and whatnot for work.

I only imagine it's probably extra hard, mentally, if you only take one large whizbang trip every so often.

I JUST got back from Tokyo yesterday. And the letdown is real. 

Doesn’t help that I flew ANA First Class in a Suite seat from HND to JFK. And then had to fly JetBlue economy to DCA. 

I was only supposed to be in Tokyo for 5 days. But then extended to 7, then 9, then 11. Just stayed in Tokyo the whole time. Obviously I was reluctant to leave. Haha. 

And I totally get it about the service thing. But here’s what I’ve discovered since I’ve been home. I’ve been nicer and more respectful to people and that’s been reflected back. I was always nice but I got so used to actually looking forward to interacting with people in service roles in Japan that I think that when I still am here in the states, people pick up on it and are nicer to me back. So that’s softened the blow

Know what you mean. After experiencing the service quality and safety of Japan, returning to Europe is always a letdown. Everything here feels dirty and dangerous.
