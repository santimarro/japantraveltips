# Food poisoning/stomach flu: what is the Japanese equivalent to Gravol/Draminine?

So we landed yesterday for our dream trip, checked into the hotel and grabbed dinner at Ippudo ramen in Ginza around 8. At 9 we were in bed (I have my 9 yo kid with me). Woke up at 1:30am and I’ve been vomiting and alternating between sweating and chills ever since. 

It’s just my child and I- this has never happened to me and I don’t get sick so I didn’t even think to bring gravol/draminine. Does anyone know what he Japanese equivalent is so I can stop throwing up? 


EDIT: I’m going to a clinic. I can’t keep anything down and I’m so weak and keep having sweats but I’m freezing. It’s now coming out both ends and my son is horrified. I just want to go home at this point. 

EDIT AGAIN: at the clinic. I’m getting antibiotics, an IV drip, an anti nausea shot, probiotics and something for diarrhea. All this to say no, you don’t have to suffer though and take your symptoms seriously if you’re like me and can barely lift your head or drink a sip. Someone in the future is for sure going to be searching “food poisoning” in here. This is my contribution to you. 

Thank you everyone you’re awesome. 

PS: this is the clinic I went to and they were amazing! https://www.ihc-clinic.jp/en/

Ugh that's the worse thing to happen on a trip. Funny reading the comments. Im pretty sure gravol is Canadian and draminine is US. I also agree with the other comments. Gravol is an anti nausea med best used for motion sickness. If it's food poisoning sickness, you unfortunately have to ride it out and get it out of your system. Make sure you keep up your fluids ( can do pocari sweat too for electrolytes). Then just foods that are easy on the stomach (miso soup , bread, rice) till your stomach settles down. Hope you feel better!

Dimenhydrinate is primarily intended for motion sickness/vertigo or PONV. 

Furthermore, if the vomiting is food poisoning induced, you don’t really want to stop the physiologic response that is trying to expel the offending agent. 

What will likely help more is something to reduce the GI irritation - something like bismuth subsalicylate (pepto bismol) or even something as simple as small sips of an electrolyte drink (pocari sweat), ginger ale or a similar carbonated beverage (an ounce or two every 15 to 20 minutes). 

The good news is that since you became ill so quickly after eating, this is likely due to a preformed bacterial toxin from improperly handled food - it should be fairly short lived and resolve quickly. 

If you’re not even able to keep small amounts of clear liquids down, or if the symptom don’t resolve within 24 hours, then you may want to seek medical help, especially if your kid seems to be hit hard. Kids can become dehydrated pretty quickly.

Get Ohta Isan 太田胃酸、 it is a quite disgusting but super effective powder medicine for anything stomach related.
