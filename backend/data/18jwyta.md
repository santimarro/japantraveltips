# People that have been to Japan to do serious shopping, what is the best way to get everything back to the states?

I plan on doing a lot of video game hunting while I'm in Japan next week, plus because it's Christmas I have a few gifts to pick up and then a list of stuff other people are asking me to try and find while I'm over there.  
  
I do have room for an extra checked bag coming back, but I'm worried about lugging it around on the trains when I go Tokyo -> Kyoto and back.  
  
Would picking up a suitcase while there to put some stuff in, popping it in a coin locker and keeping it in Tokyo for a week be possible? I looked at some of the shipping prices and they are (as expected since it's like 1/2 the world) very expensive.  
  
Any tips on getting stuff back to the states?

If you decide to buy a luggage, consider buying it once you return to Tokyo and do bulk of shopping at the end. Or if you buy it before ore bring two from home, ship one luggage from Tokyo to next Tokyo hotel, you can set delivery date a week later.

Max your luggage allowance, 1-2 checked, one carry on, one personal item. Carry on can be a cardboard box from the post office for 220 yen. Personal item can be a backpack.

I did the bulk of my souvenir shopping in Tokyo. I had packed an empty duffle and large tote into my carryon (easier to do in the hot weather months). Before I departed for Osaka via Shinkansen I packed the duffle with all of my Tokyo souvenirs and I took a train back to Haneda. I stored my luggage with a temp storage service at T3 Departures, forgot the name. Anyway it was 400 yen per day and I left it there for 4 days. Then I traveled to Osaka and Kyoto. 

Upon departure from Japan I purchased a medium sized box from JAL, T3 Departures and tape. That was about 800 or 900 yen altogether. Packed all of my souvenirs in that box from the three cities and checked it in as my second free checked bag. Cheaper than buying additional luggage, and I have more than enough travel bags at home.

>and then a list of stuff other people are asking me to try and find while I'm over there

Like another commenter mentioned - careful with this. If the items cannot be imported into your country (plants, food, veggies and fruit) or exported from Japan (certain types of ceremonial items, swords, daggers, etc) then you will be the one facing the penalty in front of the Customs/Immigration officers, not them. 

Not to mention that it's super easy to order things now from websites like From Japan, your friends might be able to find it online and get it faster than waiting for you and taking up your precious luggage space for your own shopping which runs out very quickly.

I came back from my trip last week, and I brought 1 large rolling suitcase, and one medium carry-on without wheels. I packed 1 weeks worth of clothes, and used laundromats to wash them while I was there. I still ended up buying another backpack style back while I was there to hold items I bought.

A shortlist of some things purchased, in no order - stickers, washi tapes, christmas cards, calligraphy inks, tshirts, a bulky sweater for a friend, boxed omiyage sweets, bath powders, bagged rice cracker snacks, gashapon, pins, coffee mugs, jewelry and glasses.

So what you need to consider here is how you will pack everything in your current bag, and how much spillover will go to any other bags you've purchased. Some things to consider are:

>- **Are some items fragile and need to be kept with you?** (My jewelry for example, it has to stay in my carry on bag so I'm not at risk of losing if someone chooses to check my bags for items. However, it's often nicely packaged in a box, and even though they are small, those boxes are not always easy to cram into an already over full bag.) 

>- **Are some already packaged nicely, and can't be removed for safety purposes?** (The omiyage I wanted would have been crushed in my regular bag, so I waited until I got to the airport and bought it at the duty-free stores instead. The packaging for the bath powders I bought, however, had to be trashed so I could get it in the larger bag. Gashapon is also often kept in the ball, especially if it's going as a gift. Nobody wants an already opened gashapon, opening it is some of the fun! And my mugs. If I'd taken them out of the boxes they were in, they would have exploded in my bags and I wasn't in the mood to pick glass bits out of my clothes when I got home.) 

>- **Are some items staying in your checked baggage for safety and security purposes?** (Not this trip, but my partner bought a chef's knife on our last one - that HAS to be checked, no exceptions. This trip, all my calligraphy inks had to be wrapped up in plastic ziploc bags and clothing to prevent from being bumped and shattered. This affected the amount of room I had to cram even small things in my bag, like the washi tapes.)  

>- **Are some items packed in a specific way to protect their integrity?** (Stickers. I love stickers. Love them. I have a problem. I recognize this. But, I also can't stop myself from buying them, and I don't want them to get smushed or bent, so I end up buying boxes from Japan Post and putting the stickers in there so they lay flat and don't get bent during the flight home. That is also a sizable box (9.5 inches long, by 7.5 inches wide and 2.5 inches deep) that took up a corner of my suitcase as well.) 

Something else to think about is what you bring with you from home. Depending on where you're staying, you're likely to have access to soaps, shampoo, conditioner, body wash and towels. Even hostels have that for use in the communal showers, so unless your hostel is a tent in the inaka, you shouldn't have to pack that with you. A caveat is if you have specific cleansers you use, or special conditioners that you have to take with you for your hair or body.

I found this year I still overpacked and I will rectify that the next trip by NOT bringing specific items because I didn't end up using them at all - for example I packed a bottle of indigestion medication, and ended up not using it. I also brought my own body wash, and there was 100% no point as it made me very dry in Japan for some reason. (Ugh, skincare almost never travels well...) I also packed an extra pair of jeans and a pair of thick leggings, thinking the cool weather in Kyoto would warrant leg protection, but what I really needed was gloves. Go figure. I should know better as a Canadian.

Another option is to ship some items home as you buy them, or ship your clothes back to make more room in your bag, but that is often with mixed results.

Don't spend your trip shopping for other people - if its a few things you can grab quickly fine but don't waste your experience on wishlists for other people.

If you do decide to pick stuff up, do as the other commenter said and pick up some cheap luggage in Tokyo at the end and do your shopping at that time.Actually mailing things from Japan is expensive but not always as expensive as overweight/oversize luggage fees so don't discount the idea of mailing packages.

I've done the 'buy extra luggage' in Tokyo and it worked. I've also flown down with mostly empty luggage and filled it up once getting to Japan, and I've mailed stuff to myself back home. It's really about weight, size, and quantity of items. (Overall, bringing an almost empty suitcase as my one checked bag was the most cost effective but this introduces weight limits on your shopping).

Depends what you’re buying- how fragile something might be.  I’ve shipped things before yrs ago when the exchange was less and you can ship really cheap by cargo boat but it wont arrive for like another month.  I shipped about 6lbs of stuff for $12 back in 2012 or so.    Otherwise, what I would do is bring a hard case roller and buy a cheap duffel in Japan.  Transfer your clothes to the duffel and all your souvenirs/valuables to the roller.  Check the duffel and carry on the roller.
