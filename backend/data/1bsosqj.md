# What Are Some Good Non-Food Related Souvenirs to Bring Back?

I'm planning to travel to Japan in the summer and plan to bring back a plethora of souvenirs to bring back. Regarding souvenirs, I like to bring back items that I know will last a long time and that I can constantly use as a reminder of my trip. Food does not fit that category. So I was wondering, what are your favorite non-food-related souvenirs?

Chop sticks.  Wooden bowls.  Charms from temples.  I put them on my backpack, sports bag or purse.

### Comment 2

Stationery and pens, ceramics, glassware. If you like cooking, it's worth considering getting a knife - we regretted not getting this on our first trip. Got one on our second trip and it's easily the best souvenir purchase we made.

Also, a slightly odd purchase that was worth getting in Japan - nail clippers. They work like a dream.

I got a bunch of beautiful fans from a store called Ibasen, they seem to be hits with my family. For myself I like pins, magnets, chopstick sets, and I got myself a great knife from kappabashi area

The hundred yen shop is the best for shopping for kids. Got my little sister a kanji ink stamp that literally said, "secret." She asked what it meant ... It's secret. Got months and months of mileage out of that one.

Tenugui towels
