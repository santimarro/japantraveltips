# What was your favorite thing you did in Tokyo?

I love to here from others about what moments from their trips were their favorite or were otherwise memorable. What did you do and why is it your favorite?

I went to Shinjuku Gyoen National Park and there was this spot where people were just lazing on grass. I joined them and it was one of the most memorable things for me, because I come from Singapore and the weather and fauna makes this sort of outdoor activity intolerable. If I visit Tokyo again, I will definitely allocate more time to just laying down flat on grass.

Sumo wrestling match.  Had a blast.

### Comment 3

Was just there for the fifth time and am slightly embarrassed to say I really enjoyed hanging out with random redditors every evening. There is a discord and there are get togethers almost every night for dinner/bar hopping in shinjuku and shibuya. So many interesting people from around the world all with a shared love for japan and travel!! So many lucky people visiting for weeks or even a month.

Otherwise I had a great time checking out the many special art exhibits (7 fine art museums in 5 days) and also checked out sumida aquarium (not my first time), five local aquarium shops, and an aquarium/pet convention. Loved chatting with the guys at the Ginza ADA aquarium shop to learn more about how they maintain the aquariums at sumida. Loved seeing what is sold there vs in the united states. Chatting with one of the aquarium shop owners he loaded me up with free samples! So awesome seeing so many monet and van gogh and other paintings I have never seen before and probably unfortunately will prob never seen again as many were from random european museums or private japanese collections. Who knew Van Gogh painted bats and boots??

Another favorite part of tokyo and all of japan is just the sheer excitement of possibility down every street and around the corner and up or down stairs. Its like if the ground level isnt interesting enough, then take those stairs up to see what is going on!!! And then its a different world at night!!!

I went to an antique flea market. You can find SUCH AMAZING STUFF for great prices.

### Comment 5

Had a day to myself so I wandered alone to shinjuku and shibuya hitting up all of my favorite places and some new ones eating everything in sight. Grabbed curry bread, Hokkaido soft cream, sushi, ramen, pastries and hit up a bunch of grocery stores to stock up on soy, dashi, soba noodles, coffee beans and a bunch of other stuff. I'm a fat fuck
