# What premium fresh fruits are worth paying a ton for?

We're in Tokyo now and for another 24 hours, enough time to try some more premium fruits.

In the US, it seems there's really only one "grade" of each type of fruit, and it's very lowest common denominator (aka mid). You might have different varieties of oranges, but, for example, the navels and satsumas are OK at best.

We've noticed a large range of qualities/prices for things like oranges. We plunked down 800 yen for an orange and were blown away: easy to peel, unbelievably juicy, unbelievably sweet, surreal flavor, etc.

We tried a strawberry at a vegan kaiseki (Daigo) last night and it was unlike any other strawberry we've ever had: the flesh wasn't white/pink/red inside, it was more a yellowish/off-white and the texture was different, too: dry, almost like a sugary fondant. It was super sweet and only slightly sour. (It was definitely not actual fondant or marzipan! It was a fresh strawberry) We had never had anything like it before.

We went to the Azudubai Hills market just now and there were lots of premium (i.e. super expensive) strawberries for sale. Knowledgeable-looking tourists were buying them up.

Are there particular fruits we should just pay the exorbitant prices for? We saw, for example, a 10,000 yen mango at Tsukiji a couple of days ago and thought today that, since it's our honeymoon, we should have just bought it.

I bought strawberries (amaou type) from a grocery store for like 500yen and they were amazing! They go for 3x the price where I’m from

### Comment 2

Not one of the luxury packaged fruits, but Japanese white peaches are so good and nothing compares back home. They can still be around 500 yen at the supermarket.

### Comment 3

I don’t think it is really the season but quality grapes are good

### Comment 4

Shine Muscat is a grape that Japan created. It is very expensive, but it is sweet and delicious. It is called the Queen of Grapes in Japan.
