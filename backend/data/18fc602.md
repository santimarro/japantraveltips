# No more Welcome Suica at Narita

EDITED TO UPDATE March 2024: 

Please note that the information provided in this post was accurate as of December 2023, but availability of IC cards changes frequently. Please search for current availability from official JR sites.

OLD/OUTDATED INFO:

Now that it has been announced the Welcome Suica will no longer be available at Narita airport, or anywhere in Tokyo except Haneda, after 18 Dec, what are the options for non-iPhone users? What cards are available for purchase at Narita?

### Comment 1

Pasmo Passport should still be available (for now) from [Narita and multiple locations around central Tokyo plus Yokohama](https://www.pasmo.co.jp/visitors/en/buy/).

This isn't a good sign though for the IC card shortage ending any time soon. I was kind of hoping I could pick up the unique Rinkai Line Suica with the dolphin mascot on my next trip.

### Comment 2

People have been getting the Toica card from Tokyo station. It's 10 years with the option to refund the balance.

### Comment 3

I really hope foreign Android users will be able to download a Suica or Pasmo app soon. Because wtf. I would prefer a virtual card. Makes everything massively easier, just like home (London). Doesn't help that most of my cards are Visa.

### Comment 4

Well then I guess that settles if I get a suica or a pasmo card. Landing in Narita next year. I hope they still sell the pasmo card then.

### Comment 5

For those super worries about it and unable to get a digital IC card, you can always pay a small premium and order official cards online before coming.

Obviously not the cheapest or ideal solution,  but it will get you a legit card that will work for 10 years without use
