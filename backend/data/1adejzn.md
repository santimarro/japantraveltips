# NOT Overrated Travel Recs?

Just saw an amazingly helpful thread of overrated tourist attractions in Japan and I want to know the opposite. 

What are tourist attractions/popular sites in Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka that you would recommend going to? Even if itâ€™s touristy or a bit crowded, which places are actually a must-see? 

As a bonus, if you have any underrated attractions, add those too!

### Comment 1

Not overrated:
Kiyomizudera, ninenzaka and sannenzaka in Kyoto.

Nakamise-dori


Underrated: view from the rooftop of the Seibu department store at Ikebukuro Station.  

Walk from Ueno to Akihabara, thru the 2K540 collection of shops.

Uji, Kyoto

### Comment 2

Renting a bicycle to get around Kyoto.

I did this and just enjoyed the simplicity of it. I mostly did shopping, but ymmv, depending on how you want to experience Kyoto on bike.

### Comment 3

Finding a 3.5 star rated restaurant on Tabelog with nothing written about it in English on the entire internet and just going.

### Comment 4

I like Meiji Jingu. You could never go wrong with this shrine even though everyone seems to go there.

### Comment 5

Osaka Aquarium. I'm biased bc seeing whale sharks was on my bucket list but it was a great experience, and the souvenirs are really nice too.
