# The people at our inn were very kind, is it taboo to tip?

Hello,

My girlfriend came down with a cold and after I came back with medicine from the pharmacy the people at the inn made her a care package of cooling pads, hot chocolate and and some other remedy items. Would it be taboo to tip them for this, or should we just accept the kindness? This feels above and beyond any typical service I would expect from an inn.

In Japan it’s more appreciated to show thanks by a small gift. It’s literally the thought that counts. 

Money (especially “naked” money not placed in an envelope) can come across as crass and transactional. You’re likely to send the opposite message than what you are feeling.

Buy them some flowers or fruit or if you have something personal that is small but meaningful, you can leave that with them. Even a hand written thank you note is likely to produce much more powerful impact than a couple of bucks.

Do not tip. It's offensive, and they'd likely refuse it. If you feel like you must give them something tangible rather than just a great review, buy them a fancy sweet in thanks.

Thanks everyone, I will get sweets and a card

Don't tip - but you could get them a gift. Something consumable is best - if you head into the basement floor of any department store you should find a lot of fancy boxes of sweets, biscuits, etc. that exist for these sorts of situations.

In Japan if you try to give them money they will literally fight you to the death to give it back

BUT if you instead present them with a gift of some kind, they MUST take it. Go to a fancy department store, hit the basement which is always the food/gifts floor. just buy literally anything there that looks fine. Cookies, cakes whatever is in your budget. They’ll wrap that thing up better than any Christmas gift you’ve ever seen and give you a paper bag too! Just present that and say “arigato” and you’ll be golden
