# How can we figure out if a restaurant is Japanese speaker only before entering?

Hi all! It’s the third day of our Kyoto itinerary. I checked some restaurants from tabelog and wanted to go one of them today. Anyway we waited for opening hours around 40 mins and we went to inside and stuffs throw some looks to us like “why are they here”. At the end another one came to us and asked “ Do you speak Japanese”. I mean we can give order in Japanese but no we don’t. We say “no” to her and she showed us the door. And there were 2 tourists too, they asked “why” and the stuff said “no, japanese only” and close the door. I will not ask if it’s normal or not. Because it’s their choice but there is no sign or note anything. And I am a bit upset because my partner is working at evenings so we didn’t have time to wait another queue and we bought onigiris from 7/11 🥲 they are good tho… anyway I want to learn from you if there is any trick to figure out this early. Thank you!

Google reviews of the restaurant could be helpful. Look for non-japanese reviews.

### Comment 2

Normally they have a sign that says Japanese only. Not sure any other way to tell!

They may well be referring not to ‘Japanese people only’ but rather that they don’t have any English speakers working there or an English menu. In which case if you’re game to use google translate including the camera function and lots of good humour and politeness, you can communicate that you’re ok with that and stay. We have done that a few times in the past and the staff end up delighted that we’ve gone the extra mile to make it work.

As someone else said, google reviews.

Same thing happened to me last year in Kyoto. I was looking for sushi on google and this place pops up in my list. I read the reviews where it said that I would be turned away as a foreigner but i decided I would try to stop by anyways. Silly me.

I walk in and right away the sushi chef looks at me and crosses his arms in an X.

in my experience 'japanese only' means 'we only speak japanese' and very rarely refers to nationality/ethnicity (can't rule it out fully though until they throw you out even when you spit out perfect japanese), just seems like an unfortunate turn of phrase they tend to gravitate towards.

once had an old lady chase me down the street from her izakaya, desperately apologising because she realised what she'd said after we politely bowed and left. her izakaya ended up being one of my favourite experiences in japan.

i would definitely recommend trying google translate if they are being polite about it, but i have had another time where they were very assertive and almost angry when they told me japanese only so I took the hint and left, not every establishment wants to deal with tourists. read the room but don't assume the worst.
