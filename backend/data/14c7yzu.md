# Japan Pocket Wifi advice

Hi, I'm going to Japan for three weeks in July and am looking for a pocket wifi. I am quite a heavy data user and would thus like a pocket wifi that does not throttle my data usage after a certain amount used.

Currently, I'm comparing between Ninja pocket wifi and Japan Wireless pocket wifi. Any advice/experience with it is much appreciated!

1. Ninja pocket wifi has a plan that allows you to use up to
5 or 10GB of high speed data per day. However, it is slightly on the costlier side.

2. Japan wireless pocket wifi states that it has unlimited data without speed restrictions on their website (l'm not sure how true this is). This is cheaper than the ninja pocket wifi. Thus, if there is really no speed restrictions, would most likely go for this.

I’ve gotten my pocket wifi from this site multiple times since 2016. I have nothing to compare it to because I’ve always used the pocket Wi-Fi from them exclusively. Just want to share with you another option to consider and compare

If you read enough posts on this topic, I think the basic consensus is that the e-sim is preferred. Though I’ve never used it myself.

My phone wasn't nice enough to do esim so I'm using pocket wifi for a 50 day trip. I went with the Japan wireless unlimited option but honestly... It is not unlimited. They throttle the speed after 3 gigs of streaming! Phone internet still worked after that but speed sucks. So now I don't stream anymore and download content at hotels for the in-between.

Sometimes you can find a discount code for ninja from a blogger or YouTuber that they’ve sponsored, I was able to find one by chance while googling wifi recommendations for my trip.

I have had a good experience with Sakura mobile. They also offer unlimited wifi and they did not cap me at any point. I've had days Unused upwards of 5 GB, and it was fine. 

The connection speed varies by location, especially when inside, but I think that's something pocket wifi will always have.
