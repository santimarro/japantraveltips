# First time in Tokyo. I think I have the flu and I'm very sick

I'm a Norwegian national who arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday this week. This is my first time in Asia ever and the flight was the longest I've ever been on by a great margin. When I arrived I was utterly exhausted. A combination of jetlag, exhaustion, limited food intake and culture shock caused me to have a panic attack that left me anxious and debilitated the first two days. The anxiety did eventually subside, but right when I recovered from the anxiety and shock of coming to a very foreign country where I feel lost and overwhelmed, I developed symptoms indicative of a respiratory infection. I think it's the flu, or it could potentially be covid. Luckily I'm here with my colleagues so that they can help me out, but I'm really not sure what to do at this point. I feel like my symptoms warrant medical attention, but I'm apprehensive about engaging with the health care system here because I fear the language barrier, and I'm so depleted of energy at the moment that a language barrier is the last thing I want to deal with. For the record, I speak essentially no Japanese.

My symptoms are: headache, muscle aches, fatigue, sore throat, cough, chest pain, strained breathing. I feel extremely drained and even a short walk makes me exhausted. I started getting symptoms roughly 18 hours ago.

Has anyone here been in a similar situation? What are your experiences with the health care system here as a non-Japanese-speaking foreigner? If this gets serious and I call the emergency hotline, can I expect there to be English speakers who can assist me?

Btw, I'm staying at a hotel in the Shinjuku area.

Any input would be greatly appreciated. It really sucks to be this sick so far away from home.

I've contacted my insurance company and I'm in a dialog with them, but they are a bit slow to respond.

Insurance Mod here - if you've contacted your Travel Insurance company, you should be waiting for them to respond on what to do and where to seek help so that it's guaranteed to be covered by your policy. You should be calling again if you haven't heard back from them in at least 8 hours, or if your symptoms worsen. If your colleagues are able to get you some general cold and flu medication to lessen the symptoms while you rest, that is good news, but you should be checking in with your travel insurance company again to get the proper steps from them. You pay for the policy for a reason, and having emergency healthcare covered while on vacation is one of them.

I was in Japan for almost a month in Dec and I got very sick in Kyoto. Thought I could stick it out but it got worse when I was back in Tokyo. I went to a walk in clinic in Asakusa with an English speaking doctor (I did not have insurance). They saw me, took xrays, prescribed medication as I had pneumonia all in 90 minutes and it cost me about $65 total. 

Are you staying at a hotel? Ask the front desk for walk in clinics with English speaking doctors.

Iâ€™m sorry youâ€™re sick - I similarly fell ill for my first few days when I arrived earlier this month (combination of exhaustion from long haul travel and work which was crazy busy before I left). My experience with pharmacies was excellent - Google translate is your friend. I took a covid test and was clear so just took a combination of tylenol, ibuprofen and some throat spray. Everything cleared up in a few days thankfully. My main takeaway is not to be nervous of engaging with healthcare providers / pharmacists - theyâ€™re immensely helpful and kind in my experience. I also recommend getting plenty of fluids in and try the vitamin c drinks from the konbini. Get better soon ðŸ«¡

You have 3 options, in order of urgency (less to more):

* If you **don't need urgent** medical attention, get your friends to visit a drugstore and buy you a Covid19+Influenza dual home test, that way you can very quickly verify if it's either of those. I would do this regardless, unless you need to grab an ambulance before the shops open in the morning.
* **Tomorrow Friday** you can search and visit some clinics around your area if you feel well enough, if you are in central Tokyo Google them and if they have an English website that's a good indicator they might speak English. Do NOT wait until the weekend for this, most clinics will be closed.
* If you need **urgent medical care, call 119**. Yes, it will be Japanese, have your friend or someone deal with the translation. Usually give your name and address. An ambulance will come, it's free and you should use it. Do not attempt to find a hospital yourself since they will most likely reject you, that's what the ambulance is here for, you will be waiting inside the ambulance for 10-30 mins while they call different hospitals until one accepts you.

My recommendation would be to be on the safe side, if you think you need urgent medical care, take it. It's very cheap and you'll laugh or cringe at the misunderstandings in the future, but that's better than the alternative.

Couple of extra tips:

* You might need to be a bit *pushy* with the doctors, some (not all) might dismiss or not take your symptoms serious enough. Insist on e.g. having covid/influenza/etc tests being taken.
* Don't worry about the insurance right now, deal with hospitals directly. Even if you have to pay out of pocket, it's usually cheap if there's no big issue, so you should be focusing on your health, not on saving maybe 100-200 euros. (Edit/subnote) why? it is already hard enough to find an ambulance that takes you, a hospital that agrees, then a hospital that actually admits you, on top of being sick. The only exception I'd recommend, if you have a Japanese insurance number to call, that would be good to share with the ambulance as well.
* Have a friend go with you to the clinic/hospital if you are sick enough and let them deal with the translation/paperwork. If they ask about insurance by any chance, make sure your friend shows a credit card and show a bunch of 10,000 notes, you want to appear like you surely can pay cash. Foreign/international insurance might just confuse them and be a cause of them rejecting you.

If you are staying at an international hotel chain you could always consult the front desk. They should have all the information about what to do when a foreign guest becomes sick, where to get medication or if required a list of English-speaking doctors that know travel insurance
