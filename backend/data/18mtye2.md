What are you looking for out of your trip?

MIYAJIMA!! Mt Misen is such a great hike, i took the cable car up and hiked down, but if i went i again i would definitely arrive earlier and hike both ways, the views are stunning and the island is such a good vibe all around!

Himeji! Both the castle and Mt. Shosha are stunning, and the city itself has a really nice vibe.

### Comment 4

Wakayama is such a beautiful and underrated part of Japan, and just a train ride away from Osaka on the Kuroshio line.

Seconding Miyajima. I wish we'd stayed there longer.

We took a very brief trip to Kawasaki and had a lovely time - we'll be going back next time for sure.

Kanazawa is a more laid back and intimate Kyoto. I actually prefer it to Kyoto. In addition you can day trip to Shirakawa Go from there. 

Koya-san is great if you do a temple stay. It is very atmospheric and tranquil. I visited in the wintertime and it was very peaceful and quiet. 

Hiroshima is on the edge of popularity of Tokyo, Kyoto, or Osaka but if you are able to stay overnight in Miyajima, you will have the island all to yourself.
