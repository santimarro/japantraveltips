# Back from 10 days in Japan: Tokyo, Kyoto, Nara

We are just back from 10 days in Japan, visiting for the first time, flying from the UK.Here are some notes/considerations that may be helpful to future travellers. We had a great time and were sad to leave.

&#x200B;

* Flight: from London Heathrow to Tokyo Haneda
   * With JAL, which is really superior to BA in Premium economy, and gives a Japanese experience already on the way to Japan. Even the toilets have bidet. JAL gives access to airport lounges for Premium Economy passengers (BA lounge in Heathrow)
   * Disappointed by the arrival at Haneda airport: very long queues for passport control (over an hour), and then having to queue again for customs (while they don't seem to check anything). Coming back to Heathrow, passport control was done in 2 min (automated gate)
   * Got some cash from ATM (very little withdrawal fee charged, like 0.5%)
   * Got a Welcome Suica card from the machine in the monorail station and loaded money on it (only cash accepted). Without an IC card, travel would have been a pain. When buying individual tickets, sometimes an amount has to be selected/loaded rather than a destination.
   * Travel to the Minato area was very pleasant and quick, and cost was surprising low (like 650 Yen for the whole journey)
* Tokyo:
   * Minato/Shimbashi was a great area for a hotel, plenty of shops/restaurants, close to Ginza and very good public transports (including the Yamanote circle line)
   * Public transports are great, everything written in English (or announcements onboard), everything is very clean and tidy. Never waited a long time for a train to arrive. Very cheap too compared to London. With Google Map directions, no issues (cost will even be estimated). Was surprising to see that many locals didn't wear a mask in the stations or on the trains
   * Several observatories are great and free:
      * metropolitan towers in Sinjuku, with a nice view on Mount Fuji on a clear day. No queues. We went to the south tower
      * Mori building in Minato, with a nice view of the Tokyo Tower. No queues. Close to teamLab borderless
   * We went to both TeamLab exhibitions:
      * first Borderless then planet. Both are quite different and worthwhile
      * Enjoyed the brand new area/shopping centre near Borderless (Azabudai hills). The exhibition itself was very busy, despite having to book a slot. Some impressive, unique displays, with great Japanese-style music
      * Enjoyed the train ride above ground to Planets by night, great views. Enjoyed also seeing the Tesla Cybertruck parked in front of the entrance. We won't see those in the UK or Europe anytime soon (as it doesn't meet regulations). Exhibition was fairly quiet (Tuesday evening at 20:00). They do provide changing rooms and clean shorts for free (with no pockets), as walking in water is part of the experience. Plenty of towels too
   * Shibuya: went to the viewing deck at Magnet by Shibuya109 to get a nice view from above of the Shibuya crossing. Starbucks seems to have a nice view too (although much lower), but currently closed until April. Had to pay but includes a drink. Was busy, difficult to see the view or get a seat but still worthwhile for the view
   * Ginza: went to the Uniqlo flagship store (12 floors). Including the tax rebate (10% VAT removed at the till for visitors on total purchases above around £25), items were about 55% cheaper than the UK (when comparing prices), so some great bargains
   * Asakusa: went to the senso-ji temple. Looks great but was busy, even early morning
   * Akihabara: went to the Yodobashi store that has so many floors. Great experience, so many items (and signs). Was amazed to ask for some fairly obscure item and the staff member walking straight to it (one reference in the whole store) without looking up anything
   * Shinjuku: enjoyed the metropolitan tower view, seeing the 3D cat and the Takashimaya department store (amazing food hall in the basement)
   * Had a nice electric bike tour (3 hours) starting in Kanda: cycled around the Imperial gardens, Tokyo Station, Tsukiji food market, Hibiya park, Ginza etc. A very nice way to see the town. Guide was great and was fluent in English. It was quite surprising to see that we were cycling on the pavement/sidewalks, not on the road and there are no cycling lanes. Wouldn't be accepted in many places in Europe but seems normal in Tokyo
* Kyoto:
   * Took the Shinkansen from Tokyo station, which is an experience by itself. When the train arrives at the station, it feels like science fiction/boarding a space ship (we have taken many high speed trains in Europe but this is something else). The seats have plenty of leg space, actually more than premium economy on flights. Trains are wider than in Europe (five seats per row). Chose a "E" seat if you want to be the side of the Mount Fuji, but Mount Fuji is apparently only visible for about 4 minutes during a whole journey, and of course only on a clear day. We didn't see it. Same "E" seat on the return from Kyoto, as they rotate the seats, not the trains. There is free wifi, but only works for 30 minutes. No food or drinks sold onboard (surprising by European standards), so buy an eki-ben(to) at the station. Plenty of great choices
   * Enjoyed staying in a modern Ryokan, sleeping on the tatami floor (with a doubled futon), having a traditional Japanese breakfast and using the Onsen
   * Public transports: a lot more limited than Tokyo (as expected), buses are usually packed and not on the advertised time. Google Map doesn't know where the bus is/estimated arriving time. Had to use Uber rides several times, which was painless (and avoided having to give directions in English to the drivers, since selected on the app)
   * Enjoyed Nijo castle
   * Bamboo path was nice, but very busy. If you want pictures without many tourists, go there very early
   * Booked a nice private tea ceremony, in a traditional 100-year old house (lasting about 1 hour)
   * Enjoyed the various shrines/temples, philosopher's path, old streets. Bought some second old silk clothes at a shop along to the philosopher's path for very cheap
   * Enjoyed some nice fluffy pancakes in town (but long wait to get a table and then get the order)
   * Enjoyed the food market and other covered streets (lots of covered streets in Kyoto)
* Nara
   * Went for one day before going back to Tokyo via Kyoto. Left the luggage in coin lockers in Kyoto station (easy, cheap and plenty available). Actually paid with the IC card, I think 700 yen per locker for the full day (paid in advance)
   * Took the train, which was more traditional. Walked around in Nara, main park is not too far from the main station. There is another station that is closer
   * Went to Nara park, saw the deer (that get quite aggressive when they see someone with food)
   * The Tōdai-ji (buddhist temple with giant Buddha statue) is something to see
   * Shinkansens from Kyoto to Tokyo on a Sunday afternoon were all quite full, particularly if booking with luggage space, so had to go on the Green car (1st class equivalent). Nicer than standard class (only four seats per row), but not really essential. Standard class is already great
* Other considerations:
   * Everybody is so polite, in shops, restaurants, hotels. In restaurants, all staff say welcome and thank you at the same time
   * Everything is clean and tidy, including roads, despite the lack of rubbish bins (which is annoying but clearly working). You are expected to carry your rubbish with you
   * Feeling very safe. Crime rate is a fraction of Europe or the US. Didn't see Police cars on the street, and Police officers seem to spend their time advising tourists
   * Public toilets are great compared to Europe, all of them with Japanese toilets
   * Cash is still used a lot. Contactless is not used much even in expected locations like Starbucks. Physical card is required (sometimes paid with it without entering a PIN, strange). Temples/Shrines will only take cash. Many small restaurants will only take cash. Coming from the UK where contactless/mobile pay is everywhere, this is surprising. On the other hand, there are many ATMs (including in convenience stores like 7-11) and fees were very low (my bank doesn't charge a fee either)
   * Coffee is usually quite bad, even in Japanese modern coffee shops or at hotels, if you are used to espresso-based coffee. Usually watered down filtered coffee. Go to Starbucks if you want western-style coffee/espresso based
   * Tax free purchase is very easy, and price reduced at the till. Make sure to register online to Travel Japan before arriving (or before going through border control), so that they put a QR code on your passport that can be used by the shop and tax directly deducted at the till. No paperwork, no forms. Many shops had the "tax free" sticker displayed
   * English is not very well spoken, even in hotels. Many items in shops don't have English on their labels. Some restaurants have English menus, but they don't necessarily list the ingredients. Had to use Google Lens and Google translate many times. Had some issues a few times (ordering something and getting something else, but always corrected with a smile)
   * Used the Airalo app to get an eSim and it worked great (4G speed), no issues in any locations. Was very cheap (like $9 for 10GB/30 days, rechargeable). e-Sim was data only, not for calls or text
   * Collecting stamps from the various JR stations (eki stamps) and from the temple/shrines (Goshuin) was a fun activity and will give some good memories. Make sure to have separate books, as caligraphers in Shrines won't enjoy doing work next to a JR stamp

### Comment 1

It’s funny how ahead of the game Europe and UK was for contactless pay. Similar to Japan, it took the states quite a while to catch up. I found most places in Japan still took card, just not a lot of contactless pay.

### Comment 2

respectfully, the coffee in japan is much better than in the west (idk if that’s where you’re coming from, but that is my reference point). out of the many shops i’ve been to in Osaka, Tokyo, Kyoto, so far, i’ve never had a bad cup. if you’re drinking espresso drinks, your experience may be different. i was speaking with a barista at Mameya-Kakeru and was told that pour over is much more popular than espresso drinks for coffee enjoyers. 

In tokyo especially, i’ve seen shops have a wide variety of beans to choose from and will inform you of tasting notes and profiles. similarly, the hario method is perfected and brews a great cup.

Part of the fun of any trip to japan is figuring out how to deal with all the coins you accumulate due to still high usage of cash (bring something that can be used as a coin pouch). I usually didn't try to get rid of coins at the combini's since it was too much pressure sitting there trying to count out all the coins while people were waiting. 

So here's my Pro tip... go to a Daiso periodically to buy things. They have a coin counting machine (like a Coinstar) at the self checkout kiosks. Dump all your coins in and it'll use those to pay for your stuff.

Nice write up, thanks a lot. Could you DM me or send me the link for the electric bike tour? Sounds very tempting.

### Comment 5

Thank you 💕
