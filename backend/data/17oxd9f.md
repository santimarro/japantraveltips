# AirBNB owner in Kyoto just pressured us to cancel our reservation on the app (but is allowing us to stay) - is this normal? Felt sketchy

We checked into our AirBNB in Kyoto and the owner who met us at the door told us to cancel our reservation on the app and waited until I did it in front of him. This felt sketchy but we felt backed into a corner and confused so we went ahead and did it, though my boyfriend captured part of it on video just because he felt sketched out.

He told us that to not be charged city tax we would need to cancel it, but they would allow us to stay and block out our days. He said it allows them to book more guests? The whole thing was confusing and felt weird. I did it though, which I regret not asking more questions and not pushing back more. Anyway, our reservation is now cancelled according to AirBNB but supposedly we will be able to stay the full time we are allotted.

Is this normal here? Should we report it or do anything?

Edit: We figured out why - it’s because of the 6 month rule for AirBNBs here. Still feels sketchy? 

Another edit: forgot to mention this - I confusedly took my phone out and opened the reservation because I didn’t know what he was telling me to do, but he actually is the one that took my phone from me and cancelled it. He’s the one that pressed the button.

It is sketchy, very obviously, and I certainly wouldn’t stay there.

Sounds like a deal of sorts. Your save city tax, he doesn't get the booking added to his 6 months maximum.

I would still be very hesitant to do something like that. It puts you in a really bad position where you payed the rent but gave up your right to use the accommodation. Basically he could kick you out at this point and there's not much you can do about it.

It's a shitty situation to get put on the spot like that. Especially if he refused to let you in if you don't cancel it in front of his eyes. Definitely not okay. I would strongly consider reporting him after you left. Wouldn't do it while you're still there, though.

This is why a hotel is best. No sketchy business. No cleaning fees! Just deal with the front desk and that is it.

This is the problem airbnb has. The landlord could *tell* you to cancel a lease and give up all your rights as a lessee (including access to airbnb service which is disproportionately expensive if there’s any issues). 

A hotel will never tell me to cancel my booking but issue me a card key at the same time. I paid for a room, I *need* a confirmed booking. What you did was right the opposite: you have a cancelled booking because you voluntarily cancelled it. You’re a guest. His business is totally his business. You are so not obligated to give up your rights to help him make more money. This kind of landlords who bully tenants should be permanently banned on the platform

This is sketchy, but both ways! If you e.g. trashed the place on your last day and leave before he came to inspect it (I guess you paid on checkin?), he'd have no recourse or a really hard uphill battle. (Not suggesting you do it, just exposing why he is crazy to do this). Unless he installed cameras that show you are there I guess? I'd personally also check for cameras, it's the only thing he could've done for safety.
