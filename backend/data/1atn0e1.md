# Quit overthinking your trip. You don't need to min/max it.

Go to random places... You'll find something fun to do or interesting to see. It's also okay to wander in a station, random neighborhood, or shopping area.

If you don't have dietary concerns, eat at random restaurants. I assure you 99% of them will be *at least* good enough. You don't need to eat what 9/10 redditors like. 

99% of hotels are also probably fine. Some might be older with fewer amenities, but they will be safe and good enough. Evaluate location if you want, being close to a JR station is pretty solid (particularly in Tokyo).

It's okay to start your day late or end it early.... 

Something minor will probably go wrong. That's okay....You'll get lost or miss your exit..... You'll misunderstand an employee somewhere.... You'll get something wrong about transit.... You will get lost in a station...it will be okay. 

Pin a bunch of things, make a list, have some idea of what you want to see.... but you don't need a day to day or certainly hour by hour itinerary. You don't need "the best" of anything - it's an ever changing answer. 

*Edit*: wow this blew up. To reiterate, I am not suggesting there should be *zero* planning. Hotels and flights are obviously time sensitive! A few high end restaurants or high demand attractions require reservations. Though plenty of people do go in with nearly or no plan at all and have fun! 

But in particular people asking for "the best" restaurants/hotels/"Is X worth it?"/"am I staying here too long or not long enough?". It's silly, no two experiences are ever the same. Pick restaurants where you happen to be. Pick a hotel in a reasonable enough area that meets your price criteria. If something sounds interesting to you, do it and then you can see yourself if it's "overrated" or not.

You don't need to fret comparing business hotel A to business hotel B. You don't need to worry about ramen shop X or ramen shop Y. 

And for those of you actually talking about something as far out as Fall or Winter, or even 2025, get off Reddit and go look things up. Watch videos. You don't need to be asking about where to stay or if the JR pass is worth it.

Totally agree, people get way too caught up in planning every single minute of their trip.

I literally booked my hotels and went with no itinerary and it was awesome!

### Comment 3

What a refreshing post.  Good to see.

Thanks for posting this. I keep looking at this empty 6-8 hr time block on my itinerary. This convinced me to label it as Serendipity and just let it be.

Yeah I pin the hell out of a map but I just decide each morning, “What area should we go to today?” I can’t believe that people have these 3 week itineraries planned out hour by hour, as if that’s even going to pan out.
