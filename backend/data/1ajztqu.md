# Luggage Forwarding PSA

Just a heads up for anyone planning on using luggage forwarding! Please check weather conditions for your current location and your luggage destination city! 

We were in Tokyo and are now in Kyoto, before going to Osaka to fly out of Kansai airport. 

Our Tokyo hotel staff said it would take 2 days for luggage to arrive to Osaka. We fly out this Thursday so we needed the luggage at our Osaka hotel for Wednesday. No problem, dropped the luggage off with hotel staff Sunday evening and they said they would schedule the shipment in the morning for us. 

We checked out Monday morning and made our way to Kyoto. After a day of sight seeing in Kyoto, we realized we had received an email from our Tokyo hotel notifying that Yamato could not pick up and deliver our luggage due to the snowfall in Tokyo. We now have to make our way back to Tokyo via Shinkansen, pick up our luggage and head back to Kansai area to make our flight for Thursday. 

Taking an expensive 5 hour detour from our itinerary to retrieve our items with our kids in tow. I know Yamato is a very reliable and highly rated company, I can’t fault them for this. Don’t rely on the 2 day delivery time frame especially if you’re travelling during the winter month. Give yourself an extra day for any mishaps!

### Comment 1

Just to add, sometimes it’s not just reliant on your current and destination location’s weather. Sometimes surrounding areas may have more severe weather that may impact travel between the two locations. We were just there where snowfall was minimal in Osaka/Kyoto and nonexistent in Tokyo but the areas between had much heavier snowfall which caused delayed deliveries and delays in train service. We didn’t have luggage but my husband was interested in ordering something custom. We were informed the snowfall somewhere between Tokyo and Osaka caused significant delivery delays for the shop so they could not give us a guaranteed arrival date.

I'm looking at Tokyo webcams and the difference between yesterday and today is very noticeable. The weather has definitely improved. Fingers crossed for you.

### Comment 3

Not sure how much luggage you have but can one person go and the rest of the family stay back?

### Comment 4

Good to know, thank you. Especially since on this sub a lot of people are in shock if you dare keep your luggage with you instead of forwarding it

### Comment 5

That is something to consider for the future. I hadn’t consider weather, such as snow, to cause issues.
