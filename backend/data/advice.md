**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS** - last edit 8/9/2017

The Basics
----------

First, take a deep breath. This is supposed to be **fun**. Don't overthink and don't overplan everything to the minute. The more relaxed you are about vacation planning, the more fun you'll have when you're actually on vacation.

The best way to start figuring out the basics of your Japan trip — where to go, what to do — is to **start reading**. Do your research. The Internet is filled with information about travel in Japan and many places (this sub included) provide itineraries for first-time travelers to consider.

### FAQs

If you haven't already, please [consult the /r/JapanTravel list of Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/faqs/japantravel), as it contains many helpful links and other suggestions for both first-time and repeat travelers to Japan.

### Japan Guide

**[Japan Guide](http://www.japan-guide.com/)** is by far the most helpful resource for first-time (and return!) travelers to Japan. It's a great starting point for itinerary planning and sightseeing ideas — and all the information is broken down by region and city. Reading Japan Guide is a must, especially if you're stuck on your itinerary or need ideas of where to go.

### Trip planning organization

Many travelers find that organizing their trip ideas into a **Google Document** is helpful, as it can be accessed or edited by multiple users (great for those traveling with friends or family) across multiple platforms (computer, tablet, smartphone). Some users use word documents, others use spreadsheets — that all comes down to personal preference. Some ways to utilize your trip planning documents are:

*   Organizing points of interests, sightseeing attractions or restaurants
    
*   Compiling booking information (flights, accommodation, etc.)
    
*   Collecting links
    
*   Creating a trip schedule or itinerary
    

If you have a Google account, you can also begin to create a map using **Google Maps** where you can "save" locations for restaurants, stores and other areas you want to visit. This map can be easily accessed in Japan by logging into Google Maps (on a desktop or on the Google Maps apps). Saved locations will show up "starred" upon logging in. More information on how to use this feature can be found [via Google support](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/3184808?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en).

The earlier you start researching your trip to Japan, the better. (Not to mention, early research can allow you to book tickets for events or experiences that require advanced bookings, such as the Ghibli Museum or sumo matches.)

### You Do You!

Don't forget: Everybody has their own personal interests, and many suggestions you come across both on [/r/JapanTravel](/r/JapanTravel) or online might not appeal to you. Japan is full of many diverse experiences and locations, so there's no shortage of things to see or do. Don't feel compelled to stick to a "tour book" itinerary of the "must see" spots. Research places or experiences that relate to your hobbies, interests and skills and you'll have a much more enjoyable trip.

Immigration and Customs
-----------------------

Any foreign visitor who wishes to enter Japan must have a passport with at minimum six months of validity from the time the visitor enters Japan. In order to enter Japan, visitors usually must comply with the conditions of their visas and authorizations of resident eligibility — which, for tourists who are not on a Working Holiday Visa, generally means that the purpose of the visit must be for sightseeing purposes and the visitor must not engage in activities where they earn compensation. (For more information on the Working Holiday Visa, please visit [/r/movingtojapan](http://reddit.com/r/movingtojapan).)

Depending on your country of citizenship, you may be required to obtain a **tourist visa** before arriving to Japan. If you have any questions about the visa process, please contact the Japanese Embassy or Consulate in your country of citizenship as they are best equipped to answer your questions.

Over sixty countries currently have a reciprocal visa arrangement with Japan which allows for a visa-free stay of 90 days or less. Contrary to popular belief, citizens of countries who fall under this arrangement do not receive a visa, but instead receive a **visa waiver**. The terms of the visa waiver are similar to that of traditional tourist visas — meaning that the visit must be for sightseeing purposes and the visitor must not engage in activities where they earn compensation.

Arriving in Japan without a visa or overstaying your visa/visa waiver makes you liable for deportation, detention or both. You alone are responsible for ensuring you have the proper materials needed to enter Japan prior to leaving for your trip.

Please visit the [Tourist Visa and Waivers page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/visas) for more information, including a list of which countries require visas and which countries fall under the visa exemption program.

Customs
-------

Japanese Customs restricts several classes of items from entering the country. Other items, such as plants or animals, are subject to importation regulation. To prevent problems upon arrival in Japan, it is best to ensure you are not in possession of anything that is prohibited, controlled or requires a quarantine procedure. [Please check this list provided by the Consulate-General of Japan in Seattle](http://www.seattle.us.emb-japan.go.jp/about/import_restrictions.html) to see what is specifically covered by these rules.

### Prescriptions and other medications

For specific information on the importation of medication into Japan for personal use, please consult the [Health and Prescription Drugs](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/faqs/japantravel#wiki_health_and_prescription_drugs) section of the FAQ.

Culture and Etiquette
---------------------

Many travelers assume that speaking no Japanese will inhibit them while traveling in Japan. While this might have been true in the 1980s and 1990s, recent advances in technology (ie: Google translate app, Japanese-English Dictionary Apps) and an increase in foreign tourism (ie: more English on signs) have made Japan a relatively easy place to travel for non-Japanese speakers. English can be found in all major train stations, on major street signs and public maps and even on **some** restaurant menus.

For those travelers who wish to study the basics of Japanese before arriving in Japan, the following list could prove helpful. A small phrase book might also be useful, but it's by no means a requirement. [/r/LearnJapanese](/r/LearnJapanese) is a decent resource as well and has guides to suggest apps or textbooks for those who want to go beyond the basics. A pronunciation "cheat sheet" is included next to each phrase — but we highly recommend watching YouTube videos and [reading pronunciation guides](http://www.learn-japanese.info/pronunciation.html) for accuracy.

*   Konnichiwa - \[kon-ni-chi-wa\] - Hello

Use common sense. If it seems like it might be rude, it probably is.

Dining
------

As with basic etiquette, most rules of public decency in the Western world related to dining and table manners will also apply in Japan. Generally, if you behave as you would in a restaurant in your home country, you will have nothing to worry about. Be kind and courteous to waitstaff, keep your voice volume at an appropriate level for the restaurant (ie: boisterous izakaya versus a fine dining establishment) and pay attention to other patrons for additional social cues. There are, however, several things to keep in mind when dining out that are specific to Japan.

### Table Manners

*   At restaurants with table service, your server will generally approach your table twice unprompted: First, to take drink orders. Second to take food orders. If you need more time, simply say so. The server will generally not return after you place an order unless asked by the customer, which is done by either raising your hand and saying _sumimasen_ (excuse me), or by simply saying _sumimasen_ in the general direction of a server. This is not considered rude. You generally must ask for the check if it is not automatically provided at your table.
    
*   Tipping is **not necessary** and **not expected**. It will generally result in confused reactions than one of gratitude. Don't tip, no matter how much you enjoyed your time at the restaurant.
    
*   Do not pass food from person to person using chopsticks. Instead, place the food on individual serving plates from the main plate. Do not place your chopsticks in the vertical position in your food. Instead, either lay them horizontally across your bowl/plate **or** rest them on the table using a provided chopstick holder. Both of these chopstick "rules" are based on actions performed in Japanese funeral rites, so doing either is considered in poor taste.
    
*   Do not rub wooden chopsticks together at any point. This is akin to "playing" with your utensils in the Western world.
    
*   At fast food restaurants, you are expected to clear your table and sort your trash into the provided trash receptacles, which are clearly labeled. Pour any liquids (ie: leftover drinks, ice) into the liquid disposal area before disposing of your cups. Many restaurants provide reusable wet washcloths for patrons to wipe down your table after eating, so please do so if these cloths are provided. (You can usually find them by the trash cans.)
    

### Food

*   When dining out, alert restaurant staff to any food allergies or aversions **prior to ordering**, especially if dining omakase at a sushi restaurant. You will save yourself a lot of embarrassment.
    
*   If you wish to put soy sauce on your nigiri sushi, dip the sushi into the soy sauce **fish side down** and try to not leave rice behind in the soy sauce. Do not pour soy sauce directly on to sushi. Do not pour soy sauce directly onto bowls of rice.
    
*   Eating while walking is generally frowned upon, so try to avoid doing so by all costs. If you purchase food at a convenience store or from an establishment with no seating, the proper etiquette is to eat the food in the immediate vicinity of where it was purchased (ie: Eating ice cream directly outside the ice cream stand). If you buy food from a convenience store and wish to eat it elsewhere, such as a park or your lodging, it is perfectly find to do so. Eating on the train is considered rude by many people, but it's not uncommon to see Japanese people doing it every once in a while. However, it should be avoided as to not draw additional attention to yourself as a foreigner.
    
*   Drinking beverages in public while walking or on the train is not as serious of a faux pas as some tourists and foreigners will claim it is. Especially in the hot summer months, drinking in public is unavoidable. Simply use discretion and good manners while taking swigs from your water bottle, soda, etc. Be sure to carry your empty drink containers with you until you find **proper** trash disposal. Many people choose to drink their beverage entirely while standing by the vending machine from which it was purchased, which is also acceptable.
    
*   Contrary to popular belief, it is not rude to not finish your meal in Japan. Do not feel obligated to finish a meal if you are full. Some establishments will allow you to take your food to-go, although this is rare.
    

### Food aversions, allergies and specific diets

Travelers with **food allergies** will have a slightly easier time navigating Japan's vast selection of cuisine, thanks primarily to an increased awareness of allergies and a fairly recent law passed in September 2013 that requires all packaged food to contain an allergen list or full ingredient list. It is important to note, however, that this law does not apply to restaurants and only covers packaged foods. (The entire text of the law, translated into English, can [be found here](http://www.caa.go.jp/foods/pdf/syokuhin13.pdf).)

The Japanese Food Labeling Law separates potential food allergens into two distinct categories: **Allergens Required to be Labeled** (also referred to as「材料7品目」- seven ingredients) and **Allergens Recommended for Labeling**.

Allergens required to be labeled account for a majority of the food allergies in the Japanese population and are designated as such because they can cause the most severe reactions in individuals who have a specific food allergy. These ingredients are: Eggs, milk, wheat, buckwheat, peanuts, shrimp and crab. Every packaged food item in Japan containing these ingredients is required to list it per the Food Labeling Law.

For the list of Allergens Recommended for Labeling, as well as kanji for all allergens covered under the Food Labeling Law, please visit the following links: [How to find allergy-friendly food in Japan](http://www.survivingnjapan.com/2012/07/allergy-friendly-food-in-japan.html) (English), and [アレルギー物質の表示](http://www.food-allergy.jp/info/label_2/) (Japanese).

When examining packaged food for allergens, travelers may notice an ingredient list will be supplemented by an allergen chart for easy readability. Although these charts are in Japanese, keeping a list of kanji for items you are allergic to will make reading these charts easier and reduce the risk of exposure to an allergen. The charts vary, but [this configuration](http://justhungry.com/files/images/allergy-label2.jpg) (where a blacked out square indicated the presence of an allergen) and [this configuration](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uD04AHS43jk/T4A-n9qbRKI/AAAAAAAAD1o/sfJgdTBETnU/s1600/allergyinfocrop.jpg) (where a circle under the item indicated the presence of an allergen) are most common.

Cross-contamination in restaurants is extremely common, so depending on your specific allergy, it is best to avoid certain types of cuisine to reduce the risk of a reaction. For example, individuals allergic to shellfish or crustaceans might want to avoid eating at tempura restaurants (where shrimp is fried in the same oil as vegetables) or ramen restaurants where the broth is not 100% pork, chicken or vegetable (shrimp is used as a common broth flavoring).

Many travelers with allergies who cannot speak or read Japanese have purchased translated allergy cards to show to restaurant staff while ordering. Several services offer these cards, so please search online to find one that fits your needs.

Individuals with an allergy to gluten (wheat, rye, barely etc.) may find [Glutenfree Restaurant](https://glutenfree-restaurant.com/) to be a good starting point in locating restaurants with an exclusively gluten-free menu or a choice of gluten-free items. However, please note that the selection of restaurants on the site appears to be thin and/or incomplete. Gluten allergies are not prevalent in the Japanese population, and the belief that gluten is something to be avoided without having celiac disease is not something practiced in the country as it is in the west. Gluten-free dining is a relatively new and foreign concept — so researching everyday food items that are safe to eat (ie: certain onigiri, sashimi, plain yakiniku or yakitori etc.) is advised. Finally, many vegetarian restaurants in Japan offer gluten-free menu options; please refer to the information below for resources on finding vegetarian restaurants.

Travelers who practice a **pescatarian**, **vegetarian**, **vegan** or **raw vegan** diet will have a slightly more difficult time dining out in Japan, depending on the restrictiveness of their eating habits. Vegetarianism and veganism is a relatively new concept in Japan with only 4.7% of the Japanese population identifying as such. Western belief systems such as animal rights as a reason for abstaining from animals products are also not popular or well-known in Japan. In general, eating meat is seen as part of a healthy diet in Japan — so it is important to recognize and understand the cultural differences you will encounter as a vegetarian or vegan while traveling throughout the country. Please refrain from showing disgust or anger if meat is offered or served within your vicinity.

If you are friendly and courteous, restaurant staff will try to meet your dietary needs as best as possible. However, it is also possible that not every restaurant will be able to accommodate you based upon your food requests. Unlike Western countries, Japanese restaurants do not make complex modifications to dishes and, in many cases, will refuse to do so. It is also important to note that, in many restaurants, asking for a dish to be made vegetarian or "without meat" will simply result in physical pieces of meat being excluded from the dish — completely ignoring the fact that the dish's broth, sauce or other components are made with animal products. (Example: Ramen being served without slices of pork, but with broth made from pork bones.) Many Japanese still view vegetarianism as simply not eating animal flesh in its whole form and do not see broths, sauces or similar food products as containing meat. Because of this, it is extremely important to do basic research before dining out to see which restaurants will have food appropriate to your diet.

Taking all of this into consideration, finding restaurants or dishes that are vegetarian or vegan friendly is possible with a little bit of pre-planning and by accepting the fact you might not always be able to eat the cuisine you'd like.

By far the best resource for finding vegetarian or vegan friendly restaurants in Japan is **[Happy Cow](http://www.happycow.net/asia/japan/)**. Restaurants are categorized by vegan, vegetarian or by "vegetarian/vegan friendly" (restaurants that serve meat with vegan or vegetarian items). Additionally, this topic has been covered on [/r/JapanTravel](/r/JapanTravel) frequently, so a [simple search of past posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/search?q=vegetarian&restrict_sr=on) offers a wealth of information and resources. Also take a look at [this trip report](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/7neap3/trip_report_what_i_ate_vegetarian_food_in_tokyo/), which focuses on a vegetarian's experience in Japan.

Travelers with **food aversions** (also known as "picky eating") will have a similarly difficult time in Japan for many of the same reasons as listed for vegetarians and vegans. As mentioned above, Japanese restaurants do not make complex modifications to dishes and may completely refuse to make any modifications at all. It is important that you read or translate menus thoroughly and ask for assistance if there is a specific type of food or ingredient you do not eat. Additionally, some basic research on Japanese food and common dishes prior to traveling may help you identify which foods you will be able to eat. Those who come to Japan with an open mind and who are willing to try new foods will have a much easier time than those who attempt to maintain their restrictive diet while traveling.

Public Transportation
---------------------

When waiting to board a train or bus, line up in an orderly fashion in the designated waiting areas on the train platform or at the bus stop. This is usually designated by a clearly defined line indicating where the train or bus doors will open. Wait for passengers to disembark before boarding the train or bus and do not push past other passengers in front of you in the boarding line. When boarding a train, it is common practice to move to the edge of the train doors to allow passengers to disembark before boarding. Do not block train doors.

Although using your mobile phone to browse the Internet, play games, listen to music or check social media is perfectly acceptable on public transportation throughout Japan, it is considered extremely rude to make phone calls while on the train or bus. Similarly, travelers may notice signs or announcements asking riders to place their phone on silent mode ("manner mode" in Japanese) as to not disturb other passengers. If you must enable sound on your phone for any reason, please use headphones. Otherwise, keep your phone on silent mode throughout the entirety of your ride on any public transit. Be mindful of the volume on your headphones, especially when playing loud music.

If traveling with friends or family members, please try to best to keep your voice at a low volume when having conversations. Do not shout, scream or otherwise act rowdy while on trains or buses. (A good rule of thumb is to emulate the type of behavior most children are expected to have when asked to use their "indoor voices.")

Children who are too old to be carried in baby slings or ride in strollers should be supervised at all times on trains and buses. Do not allow children to run freely about the train car or bus for their safety and the safety of other passengers. If your child becomes rowdy or fussy (ie: crying baby) and cannot be consoled, common practice among Japanese parents is to disembark the train at the next stop, wait for the child to calm down and board the next train headed to your destination. Do not allow your child to scream or cry excessively on the train. Be mindful of other passengers' personal space when boarding with strollers, and try to stick to the front or rear cars of trains where there is ample space for parents to stand with strollers.

Shrines and Temples
-------------------

Be respectful and courteous at religious sites such as shrines and temples. Do not shout, act rowdy or run around. Children should be closely watched while visiting these cultural sites. Be subdued in your photos and do not make poses or gestures that could be considered as mocking or rude. Don't take photos of anything under a roof at shrines as this is considered to be the most holy or sacred area of the building.

When entering temple buildings, you may be required to take off your shoes. Leave your shoes on the shelves at the entrance or take them with you in plastic bags provided at some temples. Wear nice socks.

There is a ritual purification fountain called a chouzubachi outside many temples or shrines. Many shrines have a small sign indicating how to perform the ritual, however doing so is not required. If you wish to perform the ritual, be respectful and do not play with the water.

Take one of the ladles provided in your right hand, scoop up some water from the basin and pour it over your left hand. Transfer the ladle to your left hand, fill it with water from the basin and pour it over your right hand. Transfer the ladle back to your right hand, refill it from the basin and pour some water into your left palm. Rinse your mouth with the water in your left hand (**without swallowing!!**) and spit the water beside the fountain. You are not supposed to transfer the water directly from the ladle into your mouth. (You will notice that quite a few visitors skip the mouth rinsing part or the purification ritual altogether.) Tip the ladle up so that the remaining water runs down the handle; this purifies the ladle for the next visitor.

At the offering hall, you may choose to throw a coin into the offering box and offer up a prayer or wish. ￥5 coins are considered to be extremely lucky when making an offering at a temple or shrine. Should you wish to follow the Japanese ritual of praying after making your offering, bow deeply twice, clap your hands twice, bow deeply once more and pray for a few seconds. If there is some type of gong or bell above the offering box, you may also ring it before praying.

If a tray is provided at the a register in a store or restaurant, place your money or credit card on it when paying. Do not hand your money or card to the clerk.

Umbrellas
---------

Before entering a store, restaurant or other establishment with a wet umbrella, look for an umbrella stand or umbrella bag dispenser outside the establishment. It is considered extremely rude to bring a wet umbrella into a building. Leaving your umbrella in an umbrella stand is extremely safe and you should not have to worry about umbrella theft. (Although it can happen, it is rare.) For those establishments providing umbrella bags, place it on your umbrella before entering the store and discard of it in the provided waste bin upon leaving. Do not place other garbage in the umbrella bag receptacle.

Umbrellas in stands outside of stores are **not free to use**. Taking one of these umbrellas is stealing. Umbrellas can be purchased in convenience stores, train stations and ￥100 shops for as little as ￥300.

Garbage Disposal
----------------

Garbage cans are a rarity across most of Japan. Be prepared to carry your garbage with you. When you do find a public garbage bin, please be sure to sort your garbage into the correct bins. These bins are clearly labeled in with pictographs and occasionally with English text. Garbage is sorted into four distinct categories: Burnable (ie: food waste), plastic/non-burnables (plastic wrappers), PET bottles (plastic bottles) and cans/bottles.

Tattoos
-------

Historically, tattoos in Japan were associated with the criminal class (ie: yakuza) — and that negative public perception still permeates the social beliefs and behaviors in modern Japanese society. However, Western concepts of tattooing as an art form or means of self-expression have had a profound influence on younger Japanese individuals in recent decades. As a result, some Japanese citizens have begun to sport tattoos, and a smaller portion of Japanese people have reclaimed the art of the Japanese bodysuit as an expression of Japanese cultural history/artistic tradition and not as a sign of criminal behavior. In general, though, it is important to note that tattooed individuals are very, very rare in Japan — especially outside of cities.

Although tattoos remain relatively uncommon in Japan, tattooed foreign tourists can expect only minor inconveniences when traveling throughout the country. This is primarily encountered in restrictions or bans on tattooed individuals in onsen, public pools and on beaches. Some of the aforementioned facilities allow tattooed individuals to patronize their establishments, but these are few and far between. A smaller portion allow tattoos of a certain size (generally 10 cm x 10 cm) to be covered with makeup or a special bandage called a "tattoo seal" in Japan.

In more rural locations, tattoos might draw a few stares or questions from curious individuals — especially if the tattooed individual is heavily tattooed or a woman with large/visible tattoos.

If you are searching for an onsen that is tattoo-friendly, [please consult these past posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/search?q=onsen+tattoo&restrict_sr=on). Users have also found [Tattoo-Spot](http://tattoo-spot.jp/) to be a helpful resource when planning their trips.

If you are wondering about general advice on visiting Japan as a tattooed individual, [please consult these past posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/search?q=tattoo&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all).

Other etiquette tips
--------------------

[More information on etiquette in Japan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette_in_Japan) can be found on Wikipedia, although many of the "rules" provided are unexpected of tourists and are quite formal. Again, simply acting as you would among "polite" company in your home country is perfectly acceptable behavior in most situations in Japan.

Trip Reports
------------

Trip reports from other travelers can be a useful tool in planning your own trip to Japan. Below is a collection of reports from our community. If you're looking for trip reports for a certain area/region, or particular activity, try the search bar (for example, "trip report kyushu" or "trip report skiing").

### General Travel Tips

*   **KEEP YOUR PASSPORT WITH YOU WHEN YOU GO OUT** Foreign travelers are required to have official identification on them at all times. However, there have been cases of people posing as police officers to steal identification/information so if you don't understand why you have been stopped, ask for 1) Translator if you need one (don't let the language barrier create a misunderstanding) 2) Reason of suspicion 3) Their badge number/id and name (copy it down if you can).
*   Always carry a small plastic bag with you for trash. Japan is very clean, but has few public trash cans. If you need one, you can often find them at stations and convenience stores.
*   Handkerchiefs are very common, but if you prefer you can easily get disposable tissues too, just keep in mind you have to keep your trash as per last statement.
*   Some public washrooms do not provide toilet paper (rare) or anything to dry your hands on after washing (common). In which case, carrying tissues and a handkerchief can be a lifesaver.
*   Rental WiFi hotspots and SIM cards are great if you want an internet connection while travelling. [globaladvancedcomm.com](http://www.globaladvancedcomm.com) is one of our favorite rental companies. You can rent online and pick it up at a post office. To return it, you just put in the supplied pre-paid envelope and drop it into a mailbox. Their hotspots offer great speeds for decent rates with access all over Japan (may be spotty in rural areas). Their batteries also last 5-8 hours and can be supplemented with a portable USB battery.
*   Bring a lock (small and big) for hostel lockers. Small lockers are often available in most hostels for personal effects (passport, small electronics etc.). Larger lockers are more rare, but allow you to secure your luggage in dorm rooms.
*   Bring your own slippers, especially if you have large feet as most Japanese ones are small.
*   A compass is handy coming out of the twisty stairs and corridors of subways. When you get to street level you know which way you’re facing.
*   If you are travelling in the summer, or any hot weather, be careful with air conditioners. Many places will blast it super cold and it’s possible your immune system might take a hit from the temperature shock and catch a cold. Stay hydrated!
*   Some hostels provide washer/dryer services, though often only one or two machines. If the hostel has a lot of patrons, be aware there might be a late night rush to clean clothes. Even though the machines are small loads they still take 30 min - 1 hr each and a long line might mean you have to stay up late or not get your clothes cleaned at all.
