# Tokyo and Kyoto next week, no reservations...am I a silly goose

Hey! Title sums it up. We really want to just relax and enjoy Japan together so the itinerary is...extremely loose. I posted a while back asking for everyone to share their favorite memories and almost none of them were at tourist spots, everyone was naming random vending machines and lakeside picnics and other spontaneous happenings so it kind of encouraged our lines of thinking to just let the wind take us lol. The only thing we've booked is a bus to take us to Lake Kawaguchi, and tickets to TeamLab Planets one day in Tokyo. I might try to book a day trip to Nara when we get to Kyoto. Anyways, we're both foodies and didn't make any reservations, like 0. I keep seeing people say we'll have to settle for "ok" restaurants and all the nice ones will be booked out and impossible, I kind of assumed this was an exaggeration because I've spent time in plenty of busy cities in other countries and never had too much trouble but maybe I'm being naive? Does anyone want to recommend some nicer spots that we might be able to squeeze a reservation into? Preferably online bc our Japanese is limited to polite phrases and ordering food. Thanks :)

Not a silly goose at all - IMO, Tokyo in particular is really akin to Paris where, yes, you *can* ball out on reservation-heavy, Michelin-tier spots, but even your run-of-the-mill, no-reservations-needed spots are better than 99% of what you'll get in most cities around the world. When I went, I literally would just be like "hm, today I want 'X' cuisine, what's nearby?" and every spot I went to was amazing - no reservations or waiting needed.

IMO, there's way too much to do and see to waste your time agonizing over "the best" places to eat and potentially standing in line for hours just for restaurants that are going to be overpopulated by foodies anyway.

Last year, I went with zero reservations.  My wife and I are rarely on time for anything we do, and Japanese culture is very much about on being time.  So our strategy was to just wing it.  For every meal.  

There are TONS of places to eat without reservations, so you won't have to worry about that part.  The biggest problems we had were restaurant open hours.  We found it hard to find good eats late at night.  And with the subways stopping after midnight, you are limited to restaurants near your hotel.

My favourite days when I went were when I just decided to get lost, A walk here, a train or bike there. The other thing is the food is so good in Japan for the most part even the chains are pretty amazing.

The only thing I can think of that would warrant a reservation would be if you wanted to try a good kobe / wagyu beef place, then it might be worth calling them up.  Otherwise, if you just want to sample everything else that Japan has to offer, you should be fine.  Ramen, curry, chicken karaage, soba noodles, yakitori, sushi, etc will be around every corner.  Personally I like looking for those rustic hole in the wall places that look like old taverns.  I've never been disappointed.

Tokyo hotels are pretty expensive to book last minute nowadays so that might be a problem, but aside from that you'll be fine.
