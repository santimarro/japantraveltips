# Lost passport with less than 24 hours to flight home. Advice requested

I travel back to the United States in about 18 hours. I dropped my passport on a bullet train about 2 hours ago and am frantically trying to get it back. The hotel and myself have both been on hold with JR for over an hour and I’m waiting for the embassy to open at 2 and hope they can squeeze me in. What are the odds I’m going home tomorrow morning? What do I do in this situation

### Comment 1

Passport has been returned! Thank you all for your input and advice. The item was turned into the Tokyo station lost and found. I appreciate you all!

### Comment 2

They can issue an emergency passport on the same day for travel home

Did you follow steps there for making an emergency appointment etc? Don’t wait for them to open if you don’t have to

### Comment 3

Assuming you're in Tokyo, I'd try asking at the Tokyo Station lost and found in person.  It is apparently on the first floor of the station near the Nihonbashi entrance.

### Comment 4

You will probably have more luck by going to the station in person and speaking with anyone from JR. 

Also report your lost item to the police. 

50/50 chance you’ll get it back imo.

### Comment 5

In Japan nothing ever gets lost. It’s a country and culture of lost and found that is of national pride. Good luck on NYC MTA
