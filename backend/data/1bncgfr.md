# Has anyone come across the infamous“Japanese-only” signs?

As the title suggests, I’ve seen a few posts and photos about some restaurants that have recently put up “Japanese-only” signs in their windows. Does anyone have any experience with this and is it as common (or more common) than most people make it seem? 

### Comment 1

I’ve never seen any, and I travel to Japan for a month every year and have been doing so for the past 30 years.

That’s not to say that they don’t exist - there probably are *some* restaurants that have signs like that, or that will turn foreigners away. However, they are a vanishingly small percentage of the huge number of restaurants in Japan.

It’s really not worth worrying about. If you’re in a city and one place says “no” or “We’re full”, then just try the place next door, or down the road. There’s probably another 20-30 places to eat within a few minutes’ walk, so if one place says no, for whatever reason, it’s easy to find another one.

I didnt see any on my trip, though I did notice plenty of really small local places having english on their signs, usually just a line or so, which to me hinted many were welcoming of forieners.

Haven't seen them (rather, don't try looking for them) but i remember a shop or two in Harajuku years ago with some signs like "No Fucking Foreigners."

Ironically, it caused more foreigners to actually show up in front of his shop and he would just violently scream at them in Japanese lol.

I’ve been here for 2 months and only saw the sign once while in Kyoto, but it was accompanied with a “we can’t speak English” note as their reasoning.

"Influencers" and content creators go out of their way sometimes to find them to get clicks.

I've personally never seen them, though they do exist however. But Japan and especially Tokyo and Osaka have tens of thousands of restaurants. Not common at all in most places.
