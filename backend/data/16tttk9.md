# 7 Days - Is Only Staying in Tokyo a Mistake?

My boyfriend and I are going to Japan in March. I was originally planning to a Osaka-Kyoto-Tokyo trip but then read a few posts talking about how each place deserves more than 2 or so days. So I ended up booking a hotel in Tokyo for the entire trip thinking that the city would be enough for the week. (I made an itinerary post previously but I don’t know how to link posts on mobile…)

I’m planning two or so day trips outside of Tokyo, but I’m now just wondering if we’ll regret not going to Kyoto or Osaka? Should I rearrange everything to fit in Kyoto at least? Or has anyone gone to just Tokyo for a week and found it worth spending the time just there?

We stayed 8 days in Tokyo, we had so much to see and do. I think I could have stayed a month and been kept entertained by all there is.

### Comment 2

There is plenty to do in Tokyo for a week, especially if you’ve never been. Consider day trips to Yokohama and Kamakura/Enoshima!

My Son and I spend 10 days in Tokyo. Didn't even scratch the surface. You will be fine with 7. We enjoyed the Imperial Palace Gardens, Team Labs, Ghibli Museum, Hiked Mt. Takao, Tokyo Tower, day trip to Yokohama.

We spent 6 days in Tokyo ten years ago and it was perfect just staying in Tokyo. We went to a sumo match, baseball game and the Ghibli Museum. Other days we visited temples, parks and shopped like crazy. It felt like a very full trip, no regrets.

I spent 5-ish days in Japan earlier this year however mine was an extended layover last minute, so not much planning and very spontaneous. First time in Japan and I was only planning to explore Tokyo in those 5 days but I decided try and fit both Osaka and Kyoto in one day because fomo kicked in and yolo lmfaooooo.

I took the 5AM bullet train from Tokyo to Osaka. Hit up Osaka Castle. Explored the area a bit, then took the train to Kyoto and spent most of my day there before heading back Osaka (Dotonburi) for the evening and dinner. Caught the last train back to Tokyo and arrived back a little after midnight. It was a crazy day but looking back now I have no regrets. So happy I did it.

I loved Kyoto wish I had more time there, it really felt like you stepped back in time. Things are much farther apart in Kyoto so I was only really able to visit one "tourist spot". Also really liked Osaka and the vibes were so much better there than in Tokyo. And the food scene is soooo much better. 

I recommend spending less time in Tokyo and more days in Osaka / Kyoto and maybe even Nara. 1-3 days in Tokyo is enough to see a lot if you adjust your expectations and just remind yourself that you won't be able to do everything anyway. :)  But, if you choose to stay just in Tokyo you def won't run out of things to do and I'm sure you'll enjoy just as much.

In my 5 days I managed to fit 3 cities plus a day trip to Mt. Fuji looool.

I'm headed back later this year in the winter to hit the slopes! :) Hope you guys have a fun time! Japan has become one of my fave countries to travel to.
