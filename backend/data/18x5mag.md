# New year period: make sure you reserve seats for restaurants, the staff didn't refuse you because you are foreigners

Currently in Takayama right now, we had a bit of hiccup with our plan because of the earthquake from the previous day and didn't book anything for dinner. We went to a few places and got turned away because they were fully booked. I found an izakaya and asked if we can come back later for another half an hour and they said it was okay. As we were standing outside planning what to do for half an hour, I witness a group of caucasians walked in and got turned away and they were talking among each other "what? No foreigners? I guess that's it..." while they walked away. 

Guys, we used Google translate to communicate with them. Very simple Japanese can be practical too. 
Yoyaku = reservation
If you don't have one just ask about coming back later. 

To be safe you can even ask the hotel staff to reserve a place for you or some places can be reserved on Google maps.

This makes me wonder if a lot of people claimed places being racist to them because they don't know the context and language.

Had a similar experience. Went to an Italian place in Sapporo at lunch, was told it was full so we made a reservation for dinner. When we went for dinner there were two groups talking about how they must not like foreigners because they were turned away.

The food was spectacular so their loss. It just sucks that they may tell others not to go just because they were too ignorant to actually listen.

Oh, for sure there is places  that are refusing people for not speaking Japanese, absolutely (I've even seen one with a sign "sorry, we do not speak English, Japanese speaker only").

But the problem is that it's much easier to be a victim or racism or xenophobia (or whatever you want) than knowing the true reason. To be fair, I've been in that situation before and felt I was discriminated against because I am not Japanese... but later realize that I actually do not know, I've been refused to other places and did as explained and asked when I could come back and like 30 minutes later I returned and had a place saved for me.

Yes, many places run on a reservations system, even when it's not a peak holiday season.

### Comment 4

Also note that empty tables doesn't mean free seats. The seats are reserved probably within the next half hour or so.

I appreciate this post. Having spent quite a bit of time traveling in Japan, it's been my experience that people hit the racism button way more than is truly warranted. Most of the time, if you just make an effort to communicate, Japanese people will do whatever they can to accommodate you. Just realize that foreigners and language barrier can be overwhelming to some Japanese, so take it a little slow and make an effort.

Google translate is great. I happen to use the Microsoft translate product. These tools are light years better than they were only a short while ago.

I found that Japanese people are encouraged if you give them the impression that you are interested in Japanese culture and trying to learn..... as opposed to a foreigner from a wealthy country doing them a favor just by being there.
