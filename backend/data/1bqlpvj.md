# Just landed at Narita T1. Regular Suica is widely available. 

A quick heads up if someone is arriving soon at Narita and needs to buy a regular Suica card (10 year validity). The cards are widely available at JR East Travel Center inside Terminal 1. No idea about T2 and T3. They don’t even check your passport at the time of purchase as it is a regular card. 

### Comment 1

Great to know, TIA.

### Comment 2

I’m landing in Osaka so I will have to get icoca instead of suica, as I understand it. 
Is the icoca card available in a 10 year one as well? I’d like to get this rather than the one-month version, if possible.

### Comment 3

They don't check the passport either when getting a Welcome Suica from the machine in Haneda.

### Comment 4

Hopefully that is the case in May when I go lol

### Comment 5

If you have an iPhone, you can also load a Suica card into the wallet app without having to pick up a physical card. Worked super well for us!
