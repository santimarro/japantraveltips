# Say something positive about going to Japan in July

I'm a teacher so summer is the only possible option for me to make my Japan and South Korea trip unless I really butcher my itinerary from like 14 days to around 5 days. But all the articles and travel trips I've read are like "DON'T go to Japan in Summer, stay at HOME, there's NO ONE in Japan in summer and if you see anyone it's a GHOST and you should've stayed AWAY.".

Honestly I'm used to making hot trips during summer to Europe and it's always bustling despite the obvious heat, reading all of these has really made me nervous, is it really such a terrible time to visit Japan?

I went in late July this year - don’t get me wrong, it was hot as the depths of hell, but I also survived and had a great time regardless.

My best advice? Get up early, go see a thing or two before it gets crazy hot, head back to your hotel for a cool shower and a nap, then head out again in the early evening. 

Also you will get to sample every cold drink and ice cream from the kombini, which is fun in itself.

You get to pack light and wear light.

As someone who lives in Japan, summer absolutely does suck. However, I get only being able to travel in the summer and there’s still tons of fun stuff.

Festivals— Summer is a great time for festivals! Eat street food, watch performances, play festival games, and check out omikoshi, and drink tons of cold, weak beer. You can find listings for the bigger ones online, but keep an eye out for posters and you may stumble into little neighborhood ones too. For added fun, dress in yukata or jinbei. 

Kakigori— I love kakigori with a passion. It’s good at festivals, but treat yourself to some really good varieties at a nice cafe. 

Cold noodles— cold udon, soba, somen, etc! Try a soba making experience and eat soba that you made yourself! Try nagashi somen (noodles that flow down a steam).

Unagi— eel is traditionally eaten in summer due to a great marketing campaign from around the Edo period. If you’re in Tokyo, eat at a nice restaurant by the Sumida River to get a nice view (and maybe a breeze) while you enjoy the seasonal treat!

Fireworks— find some fireworks festivals! Can’t beat fireworks in the summer!

Tanabata— I adore Tanabata decorations. Write your wish on a tanzaku slip and add it to the colorful paper everywhere!

Indoor activities— beat the heat and stroll around a mall. Shopping, people watching, sit in a cafe for a bit and chill. 

Mount Fuji— if you want to climb it, summer is your chance!

Seasonal flowers— google what’s in season where you’ll be staying. Lots of gorgeous seasonal blooms. 

Seasonal things like traditional wind chimes, fans, and incense (bug repellent)— I love the smell of katori senko, and the sound of furin means summer to me!

Onsen— onsen are good no matter the season. They feel really great after a day of walking around and getting sweaty and gross!

In my honest opinion; yes it is. The heat in Europe is nothing compared to the Japanese one. 
If Japan in summer it's better to visit the northern part. But that's just me.
