# I highly recommend the virtual Suica card on iPhone

I visited Japan in 2017 and then again a few weeks ago. The virtual Suica card was really transformative. I felt free to use non-subway/JR lines in Tokyo and had no anxiety about buses/trams/metros in other cities.

With virtual Suica, riding the bus in Japan -- sometimes confusing -- is no big deal. You either tap twice -- entry and exit -- if there's a reader at the middle door or, if there's not, just once at the exit.

Also, I often feel some anxiety in foreign countries -- if not paying by credit card -- that I'll waste money. With the virtual Suica -- unlike the plastic card -- you can easily and instantly add 1,000 yen at a time, so you really never need to put a lot on the card and risk having some huge balance at the end of your trip.

For Americans, the Apple Card was perfect to enable the virtual Suica charging. You apply and then instantly have the card on your phone, so you don't need to wait for a physical card to arrive.

**UPDATE: Another advantage of the virtual card is that you immediately get a push notification when a transit journey starts (i.e. tapping a fare gate or tapping the reader by a bus rear door) and then you immediately get another push notification when the journey ends/you've paid. Insofar as not completing a transit journey can "brick" your card, having the virtual card is very helpful to make sure you've definitely paid for something (though it should be obvious if you look at the reader itself when tapping).**

I mean, one of the biggest benefits for travelers right now if they can add virtual Suica is you are able to avoid having to plan around the IC card shortages. 

But you also need to have an iPhone - this is not everyone. Flashing an IC card is no big deal, and there's a recharge station everywhere that only takes a few seconds thankfully. I loaded Tokyo metro multi day passes to my IC card so I never worried about recharging.

I mean, for your first two points, a physical IC card also allows for freedom to ride all lines and easy tap-on/tap-off payments. That’s not exclusive to a digital IC card.

I agree that it’s easy and convenient to have an IC card on your phone, and that it’s easy to reload, but IC cards in general are pretty convenient overall.

I just got back from a trip, and while I agree with the idea of this post, in practice - my wife's one inexplicably stopped letting her add funds to it halfway through the trip despite mine being fine and both of us being with the same bank.

Then, she opened another one on her phone (abandoning the funds left on the last one), and a tap off didn't work on a tram in Hiroshima. By the time we figured out what had gone wrong we were in another city and the couple of station people we managed to speak to about it could only recommend "going back to Hiroshima and tapping off on a tram" to make it workable again... Basically any tap on after that point didn't work and there was again seemingly no way to fix it / recover the funds sitting on it.

Spent the remaining few days using up our coins on old fashioned ticket machines. If I could do it again, I'd probably just have stuck to a physical card to at least avoid the first problem (which seemed to be common when googling).

### Comment 4

I just got back from Japan and for a week prior I could not add funds to virtual Suica on iPhone so I just gave up. Saw a LOT of posts about the same sort of issue.

Would probably say go for it if you can get it working.

Tip for foreigners trying to add money to their Suica but don’t have a Mastercard or Amex: Setup a PayPal debit card. It’s free. No fees and it’s what worked for adding money to my suica
