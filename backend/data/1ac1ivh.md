# Please don’t be deterred to go to Kanazawa.

I’m sure many of you know about the earthquake that hit Ishikawa prefecture. 

There have been many stories coming out of the area with tourists canceling their reservations. 

As of now Kanazawa is fine. The areas that have been heavily affected by the earthquake is a different area of the prefecture. 

I wouldn’t go to Wajima, Nanao, Wakura, Noto, Ananmizu, etc.  

It’s probably a very pleasant time to go to Kanazawa because it’s not going to be as crowded as pre earthquake times.

### Comment 1

When I saw the earthquake a few friends asked if I was cancelling that leg of my journey. I told them the opposite, they will need support up that way more than ever so I'm absolutely still going and will be buying local to help as much as a tourist can.

Currently at the end of my Japan trip and left for Tokyo from Kanazawa yesterday. Was there for 3 nights and it was lovely! Really quiet with very few tourists. However, it was very cold due to the snow (although extremely beautiful). Snow was something we lucked into!

Everyone was very nice and welcoming. People seem to be going about their day to day life.

For train enthusiasts, please go to Kanazawa. 

Pre-mid March will be your last chance to experience certain JR lines south of Kanazawa, before they are handed over. This also means this is the last time you can experience them on a rail pass.

Post-mid march, you can experience the Shinkansen extension. You can also ride Japan's newest train operator as they take over JRs lines South of Kanazawa... Happi line.
