# My Cat Island (Tashirojima) experience and advice

I just got back from Japan a few days ago, and my sister and I had a wonderful two weeks. Most of it was pretty standard (Tokyo, Kyoto, Hiroshima, etc). However, I wanted to make a post about our trip a little off the beaten path just in case it's helpful to somebody!

We visited Tashirojima, the cat island off the coast of Ishinomaki, Miyagi Prefecture, in Tōhoku. The plan was to travel up there on March 10, stay the night, and then visit the island and Ishinomaki a little before heading back to Tokyo the evening of the 11th. 
My biggest mistake was the tight schedule.

The shinkansen to Sendai was booked up by the time we got to Tokyo station to reserve our seats. It hadn't been an issue at all the whole rest of the trip, but I guess there must be fewer trains going north or something. We managed to get seats on the last one, in different cars. (Reserved seats were essential due to my sister's disability; standing that long simply isn't an option and we weren't willing to risk it)
It was stressful (plus the confusing transfer at Sendai station), but it worked out. We did have similar issues in the way back. In hindsight, I should have devoted more time to the area so we weren't waiting until the evening to travel.

We got to our hotel very late, and unfortunately there was no staff at the desk.. just a phone number to call. I ended up having to download an international calling app in order to get the owner to come down to check us in. Just be aware of that as a possibility.

Now, the hotel we stayed at... This was the most incredible part of the whole trip for us. That hotel is the reason I'm making this post. 
We stayed at the Tama Hotel in Ishinomaki (it's listed online in places as the OYO 458 Tama Hotel sometimes) and it was amazing.

The hotel was about a 10-minute walk from the train station. It's small and not very fancy, but it more than makes up for the lack of typical hotel trappings.

The lobby is decorated in cat photos and Elvis memorabilia. It's very charming! You can tell the owner has a lot of personality just from the decor. There's also a whole room next door full of cats that hotel guests can come pet and play with! The owner introduced us to the cats and told us all their names and everything. It was so cute!

The owner checked us into our room, which was right off the lobby. We booked a "family room" that sleeps 5, I believe. Y'all. This was not a hotel room... It was like an entire freaking apartment. There was a kitchen and a living room and multiple couches that folded out into beds. They had a massage chair and an infrared waterless "foot bath". We didn't get a chance to watch it, but this place had an ENORMOUS television mounted on the wall. There were two comfortable single beds (with cat- themed pillows) in the bedroom. There was a full bathroom just like you'd expect in a Japanese home, with an automatic bath that you can fill from the kitchen and chimes when it's done, and maintains the water temperature you set (look it up if you're not familiar, it's such a clever system). The toilet was in a separate room, of course, as was the vanity. Amenities were provided, like shampoo and toothbrushes and everything we'd come to expect from hotels by this point. 

As nice as the room was, the owner was the real treasure. Ishinomaki is not a very big city, so public transit isn't as robust or tourist-friendly as you'd be used to in Tokyo or another big city. The owner will happily drive you to the ferry port for Cat Island (and help you buy your round trip ferry ticket on the machine) and pick you up afterward to take you to the train station. He'll hold onto your luggage and bring it when he picks you up. He even took us to a bakery on the way to the port and bought us both some breakfast because "the restaurant on the island may be closed". He was enthusiastic and very welcoming. His English isn't very good, but he knows his way around the translator app on his phone. 

Our plans were a little bit different because we wanted to visit the ruins of Kadonowaki Elementary School since we were in Ishinomaki on the anniversary of the tsunami that devastated the area. It felt appropriate to me to recognize the tragedy and also the work they've put into rebuilding, especially since I was going to be there on March 11th. After telling the owner of the hotel that we didn't need to be driven to Ishinomaki station after coming off the ferry, he offered to take us to the school himself. He even told us which ferry to take back so that we would be there during the exact time of the earthquake and participate in the moment of silence. 

This man is a treasure. I can't recommend the Tama Hotel enough. (It was super affordable, too! The night was about $75 USD)
I booked the hotel through Booking.com, and the owner was responsive through the website's messaging system, just in case you have any special needs or requests to pass along.

Enough about the hotel though! The ferry to the island was nice, and we got great views of the water and coast, including all the newer-looking wave breaks that definitely reminded us of the sad history of the area. 

When we arrived on the island, we could immediately tell that it's a lot less touristy than Ōkunoshima, the rabbit island (which we also visited). The vibe is more "old, declining seaside village" than "tourist attraction". It was nice to experience the authenticity, to be honest. We relied on Google lens photo translation, since there was very little translated into English (signs, ferry timetables, etc)

We walked up toward the cat shrine, which was an uphill (paved) walk the whole way. We stopped plenty of times to pet the cats! Most of them were very friendly and loved getting attention. It wasn't like Rabbit Island, where they're just looking for food. These little guys were climbing in our laps and rolling over in front of us to get some love. It was so cute to see them notice us from down the road and start trotting towards us! Sometimes they'd even follow us after we walked on.

You hear sometimes about how sad these animal islands can be because of the poor health of the animals. I'm not gonna say that all of the cats were in perfect health, but they seemed no worse than your average stray cat. We only saw a few cats who visibly had a health issue: one skinny cat with thin fur (who looked like it might have been older) another with some bald spots on his legs and belly, one with a hurt paw (he was limping and favoring it; we didn't see a wound or anything), and a few sneezing cats. You can also tell that several of the males had been neutered because of their body composition and .. anatomy. As cat lovers, we didn't find it a particularly sad situation.

The shrine itself was lovely. It's small, and there are a lot of small statues and photos of cats left there. I have no idea what the expectation/rules are, but it does look like it's fairly common for people to leave things to memorialize their beloved cats there. There were also several cats hanging out at the shrine, which was pretty magical. One of them looked and acted remarkably like my sister's cat, who passed away a few years ago. He was particularly interested in spending time with my sister, practically begging to get picked up and cuddled. It made her cry.. she really felt like her cat was there in spirit. Can't say this'll be a universal experience, but she wanted me to share that part with you.

There's a small cafe near the shrine, and they have a small menu of food and drinks. They also sell souvenirs, but I didn't see anything there that looked exclusive to Tashirojima. There's another cafe in the town near the port, but it was closed when we were there. I hear they also sell souvenirs, but I have no idea what they have.

The island also has beautiful views of the sea. Definitely take a moment to admire the views!

Thanks for reading this whole post! I hope it can help someone out. Feel free to comment if you have any questions, and I'll be happy to try to answer! I'm no expert, but I like being helpful.

upvote if you cried

Did that trip last October. We spent about two hours at the cafe nearest the shrine. The cats (stopped counting at 40) are in good shape. We got to see the owner feed them.

### Comment 3

Tashirojima is my first choice for a cat island experience next time and I really appreciate this writeup!

### Comment 4

Tama hotel is a very special experience :)

### Comment 5

I went to Tama hotel based on this post alone (and did the cat island) and it was totally worth it. 
The owner, Mino, is a fantastic host. if you happen to go here, there is a place that makes a fantastic beef tongue within walking distance. Mino is also a great cook. thanks for posting this, it was a highlight on my trip!
