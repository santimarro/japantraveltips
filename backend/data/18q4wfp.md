# Why does everyone talk about Suica? Why do I rarely hear anyone mention Pasmo? Is Suica better?

Doesnâ€˜t really matter. I choose an ICOCA because of the penguin :-)

### Comment 2

Possibly because many travelersâ€™ point of entry is Tokyo which is JR East, and Suica is administered by JR East. If you land in Osaka it would be ICOCA/JR West. 

For short term visitors they are all pretty much functionally the same.

### Comment 3

â€¦I very honestly just went with Suica because it has a penguin on it, and I really love penguins. ðŸ˜…

### Comment 4

I have a suica, a pasmo, a toica, an icoca and a hayakaken all from previous trips. Doesn't matter which one you use.

### Comment 5

Suica is more fun to say, and if you say it wrong you are talking about a watermelon, so that's fun too.
