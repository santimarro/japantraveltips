# Instead of This, That!

I noticed that “overrated” posts get really popular here but I don’t find them particularly helpful at all… so I thought what might be interesting instead is to have people list something they thought was overrated or a let down and list something similar they did that they thought was better. 

Like this:

**Instead of Rikuro’s cheese cake, Pablo cheese tarts.**

It’s a matter of taste and they’re kind of completely different things but I just enjoyed the cheese tarts a lot more. 

**Instead of the Arashiyama bamboo grove, the bamboo grove at Kodaiji or the one at Adashino Nembutsu-ji**

They’re all bamboo groves, you can take nice pictures at all of them. The temples have fees to get in, I think Kodaiji is probably the most expensive and probably also gets crowded sometimes but I think they’re both worth it. 

I’m interested to see what other people come up with!

Note that I think most of these are not really overrated. They are beautiful places in their own right, but they're simply too crowded these days.

* Instead of the Arashiyama bamboo grove, the **Kyoto City Rakusai Bamboo Park**. This is a big park. You will see locals walking their dogs there.
* Instead of Kiyomizu-dera, another large temple on a mountain slope in Kansai, like **Mii-dera**, **Ishiyama-dera** or **Yoshimine-dera**.
* Instead of Gion, **Miyagawa-chō**. No tourists there. Or some other nice old town in Kansai, like **Tondabayashi** in Osaka, **Ōmi-Hachiman** in Shiga or **Imai-chō** in Nara.
* Instead of Rurikō-in, **Former Chikurin-in Temple** in Shiga. Both of them have lacquered tables with beautiful reflections of the leaves. The former gets massive throngs of visitors, the latter is mostly unknown.
* Instead of Shirakawa-gō, the smaller but in my opinion equally impressive **Suganuma** and **Ainokura**. They get fewer tourists because all bus tour groups go to Shirakawa-gō.
* Instead of Ryōan-ji, the subtemple of Tōfuku-ji called **Kōmyō-in** if you want to see a beautiful rock garden.

I have heard a lot that there isn't a ton to do in the mornings...well let me tell ya: I had serious jet lag when I arrived two days ago and couldn't go back to sleep after 3:30 am. Took the first train to Asakusa (5 am) and walked around Senso-ji. I got to see the temple and grounds with no one around, got a hot coffee from a vending machine, got my fortune with no crowds to worry about, explored a 24-hour Don Quijote with no one around, and managed to appear in the background of a (from what I hear) fairly well-known reality show they were shooting in the area. Sure, I felt wiped by 8 am, but it was a great way to start the day.

I also found it helpful if you want to see the popular temples, go first thing in the morning when they open. Then, go to less popular temples in the afternoon and you don’t have to deal with as many people

### Comment 4

Many have probably heard this multiple times, but instead of Osaka castle, take a train to Himeji. The former is a modern museum inside, the latter is an authentic castle.

### Comment 5

Great post idea. Already finding it helpful in the sense of finding what things are actually comparable or double ups. For example someone said Loft instead of Hands which is super helpful since I had both on my itinerary.
