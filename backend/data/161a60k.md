# Do you have a JR Pass or IC Card (Suica/Pasmo/etc.) question? Start here!

Got a question about JR Passes or IC cards (Suica/Pasmo/ICOCA/etc)? Read through the information below and feel free to ask additional questions in this thread!

## JR Pass Info

The nation-wide JR Pass is a travel pass that allows train and bus travel for a fixed cost over a certain period of days on Japan Railways (JR) services. For a comprehensive source of information on the pass, check out [our wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/jrpass/) or [Japan Guide’s JR Pass page](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2361.html).

The JR Pass can be purchased in one of three ways:
* Online at the [official site](https://japanrailpass.net/en/)
* Online from an authorized retailer
* In-person in Japan at certain JR offices (see [here](https://japanrailpass.net/en/exchange.html) for a list)

If you are trying to work out whether a JR Pass is the right choice for you, here are some calculators:
* [JRPass.com’s calculator](https://www.jrpass.com/farecalculator)
* [Japan Guide’s calculator](https://www.japan-guide.com/railpass/)
* [Daisuki calculator](https://www.daisuki.com.br/jrpass_calculator.html)

There is no way to be certain if a JR Pass will be valuable for you without knowing your itinerary and doing the math out. The JR Pass is not worth it for many itineraries, so it’s not unusual to find that it’s not a good choice for you. If that is the case, you will likely want to stick with buying individual shinkansen/limited express train tickets and making use of an IC card for local travel.

**Note that the nation-wide JR Pass is [going up in price on October 1, 2023](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/12lnk7d/psa_japan_rail_pass_will_increase_its_price_on/), as are [most regional JR Passes](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/15aggti/regional_price_increases_mizuho_and_nozomi/).** The price increase makes it so that there are _very few itineraries_ that the nation-wide JR Pass will be worth it for. At this time, we do believe that purchasing the JR Pass in advance from an authorized retailer will lock you into the old pricing through December 2023, but there has been no official statement made by JR on this matter. For travel in 2024, consider looking into a regional JR Pass that might cover some or all of your traveling.

## IC Card Info (Suica, Pasmo, ICOCA, etc.)

### General Information

An IC card is a stored-value card used to pay for transportation in Japan. That means you can load the card with money and use the card to pay for trains, buses, etc by tapping the card at train station gates or fare readers. Even if you have a JR Pass or other travel pass, an IC card is recommended because it can be used across transportation systems operated by many different transit companies, as well as for payment at convenience stores, restaurants, shops, vending machines, and other locations.

For tourism purposes, there are nine major IC cards and all of them are completely interchangeable, so it doesn’t really matter which one you get. Where you start your travels in Japan often dictates what IC card you get, since different IC cards originate in different regions. For general information on IC cards, see [our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/iccards/) or [Japan Guide’s IC card page](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2359_003.html).

## Physical IC Cards

Currently, sales of regular Suica, named Suica, regular Pasmo, and named Pasmo cards [is suspended due to a semiconductor shortage](https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/news/sale-of-pasmo-and-suica-cards-suspended-except-those-for-tourists-080223) (except children's versions). Tourists can still get a [Welcome Suica](https://www.jreast.co.jp/multi/en/welcomesuica/welcomesuica.html) or [Pasmo Passport](https://www.pasmo.co.jp/visitors/en/) at Tokyo airports, or a digital IC card, or a card from a different region (e.g. ICOCA from Kansai). A Welcome Suica or Pasmo Passport acts exactly like a regular IC card, with two exceptions: it is only valid for 28 days, and it cannot be refunded. Please see [this thread and its top comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/15ebhwb/issuing_of_personalized_suica_and_pasmo_cards_is/) for information.

### Digital IC Cards

If you are looking to get a digital IC card, please note that digital Suica, Pasmo, and ICOCA cards can only be used on iPhones, Apple Watches, or _Japanese_ Android phones. Additionally, you cannot load mobile IC cards with Visa credit cards—you will need to set-up and load the digital IC card with a non-Visa credit card (Amex, Mastercard, etc.). For instructions on how to get a digital IC card in Apple Wallet, see [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207155).

Keep in mind that digital IC cards cannot be refunded (that requires a Japanese bank account), so you will need to burn down whatever value you’ve loaded onto them before the end of your trip.

### IC Card FAQ

**I have an old IC card from a previous trip. Can I use it on my upcoming trip?**

> IC cards are valid for ten years after their last date of use, so if you received the card and/or used the card after 2013, it’ll work.

**Can more than one person use the same IC card for travel?**

> No. All travelers who want to use IC cards on transit need to have their own card. Most transit in Japan is distance-based, and the card is “keeping track” of your journey, and it can only keep track of one at a time.

**Are there children’s IC cards? How do I get one for my child?**

> Children under six years old can ride transit for free. If your child is between the ages of six and eleven, you can get a children’s IC card from JR offices by presenting the child’s passport for proof of age. There are also Welcome Suica and Pasmo Passport versions for children. If you are getting IC cards at the airport, they are able to provide children’s cards.

**Can I load money onto a physical IC card with a credit card?**

> No. Physical IC cards can only be loaded with cash, which can be done at ticket machines in train stations, convenience stores, and 7-Eleven ATMs. 

**I have a physical IC card and I want to transfer it to my phone. If I do that, can I still use the physical card?**

> No. Once you “move” the physical card to your phone and turn it into a digital card, the physical card becomes invalid.

**I’m landing in Tokyo, but then I’m going to Osaka and Kyoto. Do I need a suica in Tokyo and then an ICOCA in Osaka/Kyoto?**

> No. Once you have one of the major IC cards, it can be used pretty much anywhere. There are some exceptions to this, but they are mostly on individual lines or in specific rural regions. If you are traveling to major tourism cities such as Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Hiroshima, Fukuoka, etc., you are likely fine with whatever IC card you originally received upon arrival.

**Should I buy an IC card online before arriving in Japan?**

> If you want to get an IC card online from a reputable vendor, there’s nothing wrong with that. Some of the authorized JR Pass website (as well as other websites targeted at tourists) will sell them bundled with other purchases. That said, there isn’t really any reason to get your card ahead of time. If you’re landing in Tokyo, the 28-day Welcome Suica or Pasmo Passport is good enough for most tourists. And if you do end up in the country for longer than 28 days, you can simply get an IC card from another region once you’re in one (such as the ICOCA from Kansai).
