# Advice needed: I've wanted to visit Japan since I was 12. Im now 38. Today I booked my flights!

Booked for Nov 2024 but I have been planning and saving since September. After all this time, years and years dreaming of going, when it finally came to purchasing my flights it felt so incredibly surreal.  Now I keep opening my flight app just to make sure the tickets are still there and that it's actually real.  


In the first couple of months my partner was eager to come too but I could feel his hesitation as the budget and reality of what 2 weeks in Japan actually looks like set in. I told him he had two months before flights became available for November and that he had until then to decide. He decided he's going to sit this one out. I'm not really too disappointed because I spent most my younger years always imaging I would be going solo anyway. It's a bummer not to have someone close to share the memories with though.

My plan is: 

**Tokyo:** 6 Nights - Staying Ikebukero  
**Kyoto**: 3 Nights -Staying Downtown  
**Nara**: Day trip -  
**Osaka**: 2 Nights - Staying Shinsaibashi  
**Hiroshima**: Day trip -  
**Miyajima**: 1 Night - Staying close to shore.  
**Osaka:** 1 Night 

I'm remaining flexible on days and locations at this stage since it's only Tokyo arrival and Osaka departure booked for travel. Accomodation booked but free cancelation.  Really want to do USJ. Hoping it wont be too lame going alone.

   
If anyone has any hot tips for solo travel, like ways to maybe meet up with other travelers for a drink, or reasons why you loved your solo trip or even just recs for good mens walking shoes, I would love to hear them.

Big thanks to this entire sub, I feel like this place has been a huge source of inspiration, motivation and incredible insight.

Food tours and bar hopping tours are good ways to meet other travelers. I did a few in Tokyo this week and met some other travelers and linked up with a few afterwards.

I’ve wanted to visit Japan since I was 12 too.  I’m 59. I just got back from my first trip there a few weeks ago.  Amazing!!

You are going to have an amazing time. Bring your most comfortable shoes. Your high-level itinerary looks fab!

Enjoy being solo and be brave when you need to. For me it was first restaurant, first onsen, hopping on a train when I wasn’t sure I had enough to get out at my destination, running for a train as instructed by staff “so I don’t miss it while buying a ticket”…. You aren’t the first to make any mistake you make. Read the signs, be kind, and trust in Japan to sort out issues.

Google translate is very good these days with image recognition translate. Download the japanese language pack. It's good for signs and menus. 

Maps will be good enough for transportation in those locations. I like to create my own map with a bunch of pins saved that I can overlay on the map. 

7-11 ATMs have the lowest fees in general. They're all over.

Bring a coin purse. Learn the currency a little before going.

Hotels will ask you for your passport to copy. Generally the first thing you can do when walking into a hotel is hand them your passport. A breakfast buffet is a good way to start the day. 

Don't rush. There's more than likely a next train. Take in the sights. There will be lots that will take up time such that you may miss some things in your itinerary.

Just got back few weeks ago from our second trip. First trip was back in 2017 and Google maps was way different. 2023 Google maps was amazing.

People here say get an eSIM for data, so please look into that. Don't be us, with the spotty reception of using Japan Wireless' pocket wifi. Back in 2017 it was amazing. 2023 not so much.

Highly recommend adding a SUICA card to your Apple Wallet (if you have an iPhone). You can tap in and tap out at the subway ticket readers, and can even use it to pay or refill at convenience stores. By the way, you don't even have to tap---just needs to be a couple inches away from the scanner. Also, you don't even have to open the wallet -- your phone and the scanner just know lol. Don't be a lameo like me and fiddle with opening up the wallet, faceID, etc.

***Note, when you go to a convenience store and ask to refill your SUICA, you ask them to "Charge" your card. The word "refill" didn't compute for non-native English speaking employees. Maybe "refill" is more an American English thing, I dunno?

Hope you have so much fun! I, too, wanted to go since I was 12!!!!
