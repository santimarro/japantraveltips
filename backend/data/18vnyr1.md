# I am planning to go to Japan next autumn for my first time and I am a bit intimidated by the intinaries I read on the JapanTravel sub. Does travelling to Japan really need such detailed travel plans?

Hi there. I am from Germany (so excuse my bad english) and plan to go to Japan next autumn (2024) for my first time. 
And I was reading some itineraries on the r/Japantravel subreddit and I am honestly a bit intimidated by how detailed some of them are. 

I haven't been to that many big cities yet. I was in London, Rome, Istanbul, St. Petersburg (Russia) and honestly I never really made any itineraries when visiting those cities. 
Of course I had some "I really want to see XY" points but for the most part I was just enjoying wandering through the city, taking in the atmosphere and the things I visited were mostly of a spontanious nature. 
So can you enjoy Japan without having a super detailed itinerary and be more spontanious? 

The second thing is, it seems that a lot of people only stay for like a few days in one place and then go on to the next. I understand that people want to see a lot of different things but to me it seems really stressful and I personally love to take my time. I mostly been in those upper mentioned cities for like two weeks (and only in those cities) and I always thought "man there is so much more to see". 
So like only let's say 2 days in Tokio seems so short. 

What I was thinking like staying in 3 different areas for each a week. Or maybe two bigger areas like Tokyo and Kyoto for each a week and the last week maybe used to see some more of the country (maybe going to Fukuoka with a stop in Hiroshima (like I didn't really start planing so I'm just writing some cities) 

Also according to google maps it only takes like about 45 minutes by train from Kyoto to Osaka ( I even saw a train that needed only like 20 minutes). So things like that seems like a great day or half day trip while being in Kyoto, for example. 
Or Yokohama from Tokyo. Like staying in a bigger city and go from there. 

So TLDR: Do you need such a super detailed plan when going to Japan or is it okay to just go to the country with the most important things in mind and just do things spontaniously?

### Comment 1

No, not at all. It’s absolutely fine to just have a general idea of what you want to see but then just take each day as it comes.

Different approaches suit different people. Some people like to be highly organised and effectively tick things off a list; others prefer a more relaxed approach where you spend more time in an area, stop and look at things, follow opportunities as they arise. 

I personally prefer the latter, more relaxed approach but there’s nothing inherently wrong with either - they just suit different people and different travelling styles.

With regard to a potential itinerary, spending time in Tokyo and time in Kyoto, with some day trips to other places, is a good idea. I don’t enjoy living out of a suitcase and having to pack and unpack every day or two and I think it’s nice to have a “home base” to return to.

No, those detailed hour by hour itineraries with time stamps are just people being extra or having a bad case of FOMO. No one actually needs one and at least half the time they aren’t even realistic. 

it’s a good idea to have your hotels booked in advance (pick options with free cancellation so you have more flexibility), and have a good handle on transportation options, including which tickets you need to book in advance. And its nice to have google map pins of the things you might be interested in so you can see what things are close to each other and quickly access info about opening hours and stuff

Make it simple:
1. Mark/save all your interests via Google Maps, so you can visualize and group them by area (interests are places/attractions/restaurants you would like to go but not necessarily required; give yourself options like a bucketlist)
2. Then create a rough plan of which day you want to go to which area
3. If the weather changes, like rainy or cloudy, you can be flexible and go to another area instead
4. With all of them already marked on Google Maps, you really don't have to have a plan and be spontaneous whenever.  Go to one interest you feel like, for the day, and easily know whatelse are near you.  Chill and relaxing day.

This works on all cities in Japan, Kyoto, Osaka, etc...

Grouping them helps with time saving, so you can jump from one to another interest without wasting so much time on transportation and walking.

For example, let's say you want to go to Tokyo Sky Tree, on the East side of Tokyo, for sight seeing interest.  But then have dinner plan interest in SHIBUYA, on the West side of Tokyo.   A one-way train ride from Tokyo Sky Tree to SHIBUYA Station takes ~40mins.

I made that mistake on my previous trip, not understanding all my interests geographically, Tokyo is just a massive city.


Side Notes ---------------------

There are few things you need to plan ahead or remember to do:
- Not all interests are open 7 days a week, or all day.  For example, a restaurant might close on a certain day(s) of the week, like Monday. Or the restaurant closes after lunch and reopen again at dinner.
- Some interests might require advanced booking if you want to visit at a certain day/time.  For example, SHIBUYA Sky, if you want to go at sunset, you really want to buy a ticket online day(s) prior because they sell out quickly.  Trying to access SHIBUYA Sky at prime time without pre-booked tickets could mean waiting for hours and not being able to access at the time/day you want.
- Some interests required a reservation to access.  For example, some restaurants, especially in Kyoto required a reservation for dinner but not required for lunch.  Sometimes, you need to make the reservation weeks ahead of time, so research early to see if you need to reserve and are able to make online reservations.

Hah don’t worry about that sub. If you want to ask questions you have to basically prove you’ve done research by providing an insanely detailed itinerary, and they direct more basic questions to this sub. Don’t be intimidated.

### Comment 5

No way do you need a detailed itinerary. I actually feel a bit sorry for people who post them because it's just making travel seem like hard work. But then again, I seem to travel like you. I made a short list of must see places and wing the rest. There are a few places like the Ghibli Museum that you need to plan ahead so once you have your must see sites, just double check that tickets will be easy to come by.

Unless you are visiting at a busy time of year like Golden Week, you could easily book accommodation in Tokyo to get started then wing it from there. 

I've been to Japan dozen of times and the best times I've had have never been on any itinerary.
