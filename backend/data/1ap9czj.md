# Things to buy

Is there anything you bought in Japan that it's a must-buy for travelers?

1) coin purse. Japan is better about not needing cash but many places still are cash only. You’re going to need a coin purse.

2) handkerchief. Bathrooms may or may not have hand towels or air dryer. This is especially true at temples. A handkerchief will be your god send for not only drying hands. Or if you’ve made the terrible decision to go to Japan in the summer, to wipe the continual sweat off your face

3) small eco bag. As stores will charge you for bags it’s best to carry one for yourself so you’re not constantly getting the 5-10yen fees

Nail clippers! The ones like green bell and seki are awesome, I love the ones with plastic sides as they prevent the clippings from spraying around the room and keeping the mess down.

Coin purse is a pretty smart buy, also doubles as a nice souvenir if you get one of those nice home-made looking ones that they sell on the street.  You'll end up carrying A LOT of coins in Japan.
