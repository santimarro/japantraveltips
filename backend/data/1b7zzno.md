# Parts of Gion District now closed off to tourists due to disrespect 

I just read about this. Apparently itâ€™s been a rising problem for years that tourists are mistreating the Geishas and forcing them to stop for photos. What a sad time we live in where smart phones and social media have created hordes of mindless, disrespectful people. How simple minded do you have to be to act this way? Do you really think your photo is so special out of a sea of nearly identical photos? Truly, the iPhone was the death of photography and the beginning of true disconnect. 

Does anyone know specifically which area/streets of Gion will be closed off?

This effectively only means that side-alleys that are private property and not public roads will be closed off and anyone caught that is not a resident would most likely be charged with trespassing.

So nothing will change for majority of people, except creepy people hunting for maiko/geisha photos will now more often get behind the bars.

While some of those alleys had small bars/businesses - they generally were run in a private club manner anyway.

I decided to look it up and found this article, if anyone wants more info: https://www.cnn.com/travel/geisha-paparazzi-overtourism-kyoto-intl-hnk/index.html

It doesn't say explicitly, but it sounds like the private roads that are residential and were banned for photography already, will be the ones closed off

read about this on [cnn](https://www.cnn.com/travel/geisha-paparazzi-overtourism-kyoto-intl-hnk/index.html).

it's really sad for people who are actually respectful but i can't blame the city for protecting its geishas and parts of its heritage. just sucks that we all have to miss out on such culturally rich areas because of some entitled knuckleheads. 

kind of ironic because i'm going to japan next month and staying in gion lol

This is such a bummer. Gei/maiko and traditional dance (buyo) were my entryways into my love for Japanese culture as a kid, and on a recent trip I was fortunate enough to see gei/maiko several times on the street. Iâ€™d never stop them or photograph them (unless explicitly allowed to) but those sightings were such a treasured experience for me that I feel sad for all of the people that will miss out because of a few bad apples. 

Inconsiderate jerks ruin shit for everyone ðŸ˜”
