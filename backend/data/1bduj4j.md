# Any surprisingly good non-Japanese food during your trip to Japan?

Obviously Japan does Japanese food really good...but are there any other types of foods you found that were surprisingly very good? For instance, if Tokyo had some insanely good burrito or pizza.

I plan to eat Japanese food for most of my 2 week trip, but I wouldn't be opposed to experiencing how the Japanese make food from cultures.

edit: bruhh i forgot i posted this and come back to 60 comments in an hour ðŸ˜­ thanks all

edit: so here's a list of the top things people are recommending:

* french food (specifically french patisseries / bakeries)
* neopolitan pizza
* italian food (pastas)
* indian food (curry)
* mexican food
* mcdonalds
* spanish food (paella)
* korean bbq
* hamburgers (shogun burger)
* chinese food (in chinatown)

### Comment 1

French patisserie. All the best pattisier in Japan study in France, and it has a strong influence on any cake you can find. The bakeries in general are just excellent, great places for breakfast and affordable.

### Comment 2

Neopolitan pizza tends to be quite good in Japan. Tokyo has some really big names like Pizza Studio Tamaki, Pizza Strada, and the Pizza Bar on 38th. Tamaki is the 2nd best pizza I've had in the world (#1 is at Fiata in Hong Kong).

They really like French and Italian food, though I rarely eat either of these. They're everywhere, though. I do not eat wafu pasta, though (the really Japanified version of pasta).

Have had doner kebab pita (in Ameyokocho, Ueno) - great stuff.

I'll also throw in Okinawan food, mostly because while it's "Japanese", it's also influenced a lot by Chinese and somewhat American food. Do love me some champuru.

### Comment 3

Desserts in general are great in Japan. I suppose you could call them "Japanese food" at this point, so maybe they don't count, but things like soufflÃ© pancakes, fruit parfaits, waffles with fruit, crepes, macarons, and other French-inspired desserts are common and excellent.

If coffee is your thing, Japan has a great speciality coffee culture, with a lot of famous roasters.

### Comment 4

Thereâ€™s a lovely little French restaurant walking distance from Nara deer park with delicious quiche and pies called Monsieur PÃ©pÃ©. I really recommend it if you want something different than Japanese fare. The owner studied at Le cordon bleu.

### Comment 5

Indian food~> Iâ€™ve been to several great places in Tokyo for their curry, naan, and laasi/chai lunch sets. 
Korean-> used to frequent a place by the University of Tokyo when I studied abroad
Chinese-> Yokohama Chinatown is the largest Chinatown in the world with tons of restaurants. Really canâ€™t go wrong.
