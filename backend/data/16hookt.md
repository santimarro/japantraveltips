# What is worth splurging extra money on when visiting Japan?

Sorry if question is poorly worded lol. I'm just wanting to know what something you spent more money on than usual and found it to be worth it? 

For example some recommend the extra cost for Green Car with JR Rail Pass. Or maybe there's some special attractions that might be worth spending extra on to cut the line. This question is geared more for services/experiences rather than physical items like Japans famous snacks, stationary, and knives.

 I'm in the process of budgeting for my trip so trying to account for random expenses like this that can make my trip that much better! Thank you.

Kind of disagree on Green Car. You mostly just have a bit more space. Regular car is already pretty good.

I would say a night in a ryokan with kaiseki meal. Does not have to be the most luxurious, does not have to be with a room with private onsen either,

Instead of buying a ticket to something like Skytree to see the city, go to a high rise bar like at the Andaz Toranomon Hills or Prince Park Tower.  Sure, the drinks are wildly overpriced and sometimes there is a cover charge, but there's also no line, you get a seat, and you can stay for hours soaking in the skyline and enjoying a drink.

This is a great question. I’ve been going back an fort to Japan for 20 years and I see so many people passing up once in a lifetime experiences just to save $3. 

A lot of good suggestions were already made, but I also want point out that Tokyo (and Japan in general) is the epicenter of international fashion. 

Spend some time shopping at the department stores like OIOI (pronounced “marui”), Isetan, Sogo, Daimaru, Parco, Takashimaya, etc. There are sooo many Japanese fashion brands that don’t exist outside of the country. I go there for menswear, but women should definitely check out 109 in Shibuya. Also, areas like Cat Street, Daikanyama and Shimokitazawa are the ultimate destinations for modern/street wear. 

If you’re into outdoor wear, check out Mont Bell which is their version of Patagonia. Comme ca Ism is the Japanese version of Zara. If you don’t like the clothes, check out Porter bags (Yoshida and Co). I get compliments all the time on the Porter business bag I bring to work. Also, there are literally too many Japanese denim brands to mention. 

Fashion may not be your thing, but I think this is often overlooked. Personally, I bring an empty suitcase with me every time I’m there and fill it with clothes on the way back.

Probably an unpopular opinion but paying to upgrade from Economy to Premium Economy for the flight there or back is one that I've never really regretted.

1. Splurge on accommodations for their location - if you are sightseeing, shopping sometimes it's nice to be able to drop off stuff and rest in between your itinerary.
2. Splurge on luggage transfer service (unless you are traveling with a  carry on) - don't have to navigate the train stations with your bags. Also,the possibility to start your day in a new city without worrying about dropping off your bags first. 
3. Cheap eats are great in Japan but why not splurge on one or two fancier meals or cocktail bars. I don't think you have to go for Michelin stars necessarily, there are plenty of great ones that did not make the list (check Tabelog for rating).
4. If it's your first time, depending on your interest (culinary, architecture, history, etc), hiring a guide for a day maybe worthwhile. We did a private one several years ago for Tsukiji market and outer markets. I was able to ask questions and get tips on where to eat, where to buy knives, specific kitchen tools and ingredients.
