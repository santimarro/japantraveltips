# What does a rest day look like in Japan?

I keep seeing this as a tip, but I cant imagine sitting in my hotel room all day.

Whats your idea of a 'rest day' while on vacation?

### Comment 1

I don't think "sit around in your hotel all day" is typically what people mean by a "rest day", unless they have maybe a very nice hotel or ryokan. 

For me, a "rest day" might mean:

* A day where I have nothing planned, so I can get up when I want and decide what I want to do based on how I feel.
* A day where I stick close to my hotel area so that I can take breaks, have a nap, etc.
* A day where I visit a bunch of cafés and read a book or people watch.
* An overnight in an onsen town where the activities largely consist of eating, relaxing in the hot springs, hanging out on the property or in the tiny town, etc.
* A day where I do some self-care activities like get a massage or take a yoga class.

It's less about "do nothing" and more about mixing up your activities so that you're not walking 20k+ steps every day, rushing from place to place, taking a 3-hour each way day trip with multiple train connections, etc. A "rest day" might simply be doing less or planning to do less than other days, or it might mean doing a leisurely activity.

It's different for everybody. Some people do just chill at the hotel/apartment all day. Some folks say resting is doing only a little visiting. 

Me?

I sleep in, wake up when I want. Go eat lunch and that place I saw the other day. Go for a walk in Shibuya or Akiba with no real purpose or goal. Eat a nice dinner, maybe go for a drink. Go to an onsen.

Just like, live man.

I sit in coffee shops and read, or take it more leisurely and go shopping and browsing in a single area or spend a lot more time playing arcade games or whatever. "Rest" day to most people means not walking 10+ miles for the day to try to crush in a bunch of activities.

It’s a day where I have no plans - I have a sleep in, I just wander around at a pace that feels comfortable and relaxing, grab something to eat and people watch, maybe go for a browse through some shops or an arcade. Get some laundry done. It’s just a day that isn’t scheduled with a bunch of activities and scurrying all over the place tbh

Our rest day was still walking around but rather than trying to visit tourist spots, we just stayed near our hotel and explored our neighborhood. We slept in and started later and ended earlier, and would look for cafes and just chat or enjoy the ambience. We would look for parks to sit with our street food snacks, and just watch the kids play. Pretty much we would just take it more easy and just absorb that we were in Japan.
