# Just realized we booked during Golden  Week

Going to Japan next month and just realized it's going to be during Golden Week, does anyone have any tips or experience with this?

Edit:
Thank you all for the responses yeah best we can do is start our reservations now. We'll be there from the 26th to the 7th ðŸ˜­

It's a bad time to go to Kyoto, Kamakura, theme parks, popular tourist spots, etc. Perfectly good time to get out to places like Tohoku, Shikoku, Shimane, etc. There should be festivals on around the place so it's not like it's only downsides. But yeah, if you've got your heart set on seeing all the big sites of Kyoto or whatever you're bound to be there with thousands of extra domestic tourists.

I thought it would have been okay. No, this was not fun every restaurant my wife and went to had 20 people waiting to go in. The pokecenter had a 6 hour line. You had to make a reservation with a other poker enter. The mall was like Disney land so many people and the train felt like I was just carried away with a crowd like a single fish in a school.

Depends on your itinery. Tokyo is never too bad as the Locals have gone to do everything the foreign influx of tourists have come for. So if Kyoto, Disneyland, USJ etc are in your plans then you will sadly be in for a rough time. Airports (depending on your dates or arrival / departure) are pretty horrendous as are the large train stations. If you intend to do any internal travel then make sure you book at the earliest opportunity for anywhere between the 26th/27th-5th/6th. Shinkansen especially. Personally I'd forget Domestic flights during this period as FF members in Japan get early access to many seats and then comes the rush for whatever is left.

Restaurants are generally open throughout nowadays, BUT high end Sushi, Yakitori and many independent Ramen shops will close for at least 2/3 of your time here.

This is first GW since 2019 truly free of Covid Restrictions, add the domestic demand to the enormous influx of tourists with the weak yen if you have anyway of rescheduling I'd seriously consider it. As a resident here, I want you to see the best of what Japan has to offer.

Get tickets and reservations for whatever you can now.
Plan extra time for transit and lines. 
Be patient, employees are doing their best.
Have fun.

 I have been to Tokyo during Golden Week at least 5 times in the past 10 years, because that's when my JPN frd is off work and is free to hang out. There's usually a couple events I want to attend that's hosted during Golden Week holiday. People who said you're screwed are overreacting tbh. Will it be crowded? Yes. Will it ruin your trip? No. Just plan accordingly, mentally prepare for crowds, book your hotels NOW, and you'll be fine.

If the restaurants you want to go to accept online reservations, book well ahead. If there are events selling online tickets, book as soon as they're available. With adequate planning you'll have fun during Golden Week.
