# No real itinerary for my first trip to Japan...

My planning strategy for the day-to-day part of trips is generally "wing it." I'll be visiting Tokyo for about a week next week and this is what my itinerary looks like so far:

**Day 1:**

*5 AM* - Arrive at Haneda

Do customs/visa things

Get cash from 7-11 ATM

Get IC card as I will only be using my feet and public transportation

Eat food, maybe in the airport

Stop at Anytime Fitness in the Ota or Shingawa areas for shower/light exercise/change of clothing

Eat food/explore

*3 PM* - check in at hotel near Taito/Asakusa

Eat food/explore

**Day 2 â€” 7**

Eat food/explore

**Day 8**

Eat food/explore on the way to Haneda

Leave on 2 PM flight


**Is this lack of structure a giant mistake?** ðŸ˜² Will I just be completely lost all of the time without any real itinerary?

The things I'm interested in doing are visiting museums/historical sites, eating, visiting parks, eating, visiting Akhibara for the otaku-ness, eating, and anything else that looks interesting.

I may low-key shop for clothing that isn't high end but am not certain how I'll ~~fair~~ fare as I wear an American woman's size M in shirts and size 12 in pants.

For reference, not sure if this makes a difference, I did learn katakana and hiragana and just the tiniest smidgen of kanji (mostly I recognize æ°´). In Japanese, I can introduce myself, say thank you, and ask where things are but will not understand the response except for "left").

You could always try a public bath to get the whole Japan experience.   
  
I donâ€™t think a lack of itinerary is necessarily bad, but itâ€™s not a bad idea either to look up places that would interest you to plan what youâ€™ll do the next day, for exemple. You don't want to waste time bouncing all over the city. For exemple, it's really easy to hit Shinjuku (Especially the Shinjuku Gyoen park), Meiji Temple, Harajuku and Shibuya in the same day, they're within walking distance of one another. You can visit Character Street at Tokyo Station and then go out and visit the Imperial Palace Ground (it's FREE! You just need to pick up a token at the entrance). Ueno is a good place with a good concentration of stuff to see and do, with multiple museums, the park and the temples and food, etc. 

Akihabara Is fun but I would go there in the evening when itâ€™s all lit up. Look up where the Mandarake complex is! Another fun spot for used anime stuff is Nakano Broadway. That oneâ€™s all indoor so you can go anytime, but itâ€™s also pretty far out. 

Get the Tokyo Museum Grutto Pass: [https://www.rekibun.or.jp/en/grutto/](https://www.rekibun.or.jp/en/grutto/)

It can give you ideas of things to visit. Maybe try to get a ticket to DisneySea? 

Also, don't forget that not all shops and restaurants are at ground level, so keep an eye out for opportunities on different floors.

Food is my usual emphasis when i travel. As someone who also doesnâ€™t like strict itineraries my go to method is to bookmark all the food spots that I may want to try in google maps then checking the map to see where everythingâ€™s most condensed. Those will be the areas i explore since the best eats are usually clustered in the most interesting areas. Hasnâ€™t failed me yet!

Just got back from a week long visit and I just winged the entire trip and had the best time. Highest of recommendations.

### Comment 4

I have the same idea for my trip starting tomorrow for 10 days. Honesty it'll probably be fine. Getting lost and meandering around is half the fun of traveling

### Comment 5

This is a perfectly fine way of traveling to Japan. As long as you're not concerned about maximizing your time. If you think you're gonna be coming back for multiple visits in the future again should be fine.

However, if this is a once in a lifetime trip, or you are the type of person who would regret missing things just because you didn't do some research beforehand, then you may just want to add some structure in your trip. Some of your interest do require some background research as to what is around (museums/historical sites).

As for language comprehension you should download google translate and download the Japanese language pack. While it's great that you learned the Kanas most signage and text you will encounter will have heavy use of Kanji, so a translation app is a must. You can get on perfectly fine without knowing Japanese. Most transit signage will be in both Japanese and English/Romanji.

Regardless a couple things to keep in mind

- Many restaurants/shops don't open to late in the morning, you can use early morning hours to explore parks.
- Weekends are rough for restaurants if you don't have reservations some place. Popular places will have very long lines. You can usually find some less popular places with no lines or shorter lines, but food maybe hit or miss.
- Transit is very good so you don't need to limit yourself to areas if your looking for something to eat/do. Most places are within 20min subway/train ride within central Tokyo.
- Tokyo is a very vertical city meaning that what you see on the ground level is just the tip of the iceberg when you are looking for restaurants and shops.
- If you are planing to be out late just keep in mind when last trains are and give yourself the appropriate time to make to back to your hotel. Taxis can be expensive if you miss the last train. You can always stick within walking distance if your hotel too if you are situated in a commercial district there should be plenty to do at night.
- If you're getting ramen at a shop that has a ticket vending machine the top left corner option will always be the Shops recommended/most popular ramen so you can never go wrong by just picking that.
