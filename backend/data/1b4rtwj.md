# Bring your own napkins

We love Japan - so much that we visit each year.  Go to Tokyo and then explore a new city each year and then always end with Tokyo DisneySea.  It is our happy place and love most everything about the country...except what is the deal with the napkins?  They are tiny and have this waxy coating on them that make it impossible to actually do anything they are designed for :)  We now bring some napkins (and salt packets as I love my stuff salty and they are impossible to find) with us when we go out to eat.  From Disney to Coco Curry, to 7-11 to Department store restaurants - all with the same waxy napkins.  Is there a monopoly on them in Japan?  :)

I think a lot of Japanese people carry around handkerchiefs to help with this. I remember sitting at lunch with some students when I accidentally spilled my tea. Every student whipped out a handkerchief to help me clean up.

I do agree, though, that restaurant napkins in Japan are atrocious at absorbing anything.

TIL, squeeze in your luggage - a stack of paper towels and (from another post) a roll of Charmin -  when traveling to Japan.

### Comment 3

I'm used to having the sealed moist napkins in every restaurant which does the job.

Clean cloth handerchiefs can have more than one function
