# Back from my first trip to Japan. A few points... 

Just wanted to share some points from my recent trip which might be useful. 
First of all, I loved Japan. I had my share of trips (Europe, America, Asia, Africa), but Japan is really unique. And honestly, I was struck by the kindness and the people. With a bit of luck, this will be only my first trip, and can't wait to go back. 

So, about my points:
Don't underestimate transfer times. Even though Japanese public transport is practically impeccable, commuting from one place to the other will take time. Try not to fit too much in one day (this is true especially for Kyoto, where many locations are reachable by bus). 
We found that keeping a free extra day in Tokyo allowed us to see and do what we weren't able to do on the other days for one reason or another. Four days feeled a bit rushed, even without day-trips.

Cash isn't king, at least in the traditional first time locations (Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Nara, Hiroshima). A small amount of cash will be necessary indeed, but in many occasions you can just use an IC card or a credit card. Conbini ATMs usually have fair change rates. 

Google maps and google translator (in particular the picture translator) are fundamental. Google maps even tells you the right metro exit for your itinerary! 

Public transport is really easy to grasp, once there. I was a bit worried about that before our trip, but  really, everything is well indicated and understandable. Even if you get out from the wrong exit, it's fine, you will just have a longer walk. 

Yes, you'll walk a lot. We covered 160km (or 100 miles) by foot in 12 days. Good walking shoes are a must. 

Shinkansen tickets will also cover the metro ticket just after arriving to your destination. I'm not sure this is true for every city, but it's definitely true for Tokyo. 

The luggage shipment system frome hotel to hotel was a godsend. It allowed us to visit Himej on our way from Hiroshima to Osaka without having to get mad with all our suitcases (they probably wouldn't have fit coin lockers...). 

One curious thing: in some tourist attractions spots, the maps found around where "upside down", having the south on top and north on the bottom. 😅

PS: Since many are asking about the luggage shipment fares, I'll post the link here:

Agree 1000x with transfer time. Sometimes google map is deceiving in that it assumes once you “enter” the subway you get instant access to the train. But most of the time you need to walk 5-10 minutes to get there.

So sometimes when google says it takes 20 minutes, it actually takes 30-40 due to all the walking inside train stations.

### Comment 2

I'll just point out something I learnt today that on Google translate it will always try to translate using internet (even if you have downloaded the language) and if you in a poor connection area then disable the internet and as long as you downloaded the language beforehand it will work perfectly.

In Japan, maps are often oriented based on their placement. This means that what's up on the map is right in front of the viewer, and what's down is right behind them. This makes it easy to figure out which street on the map is which street in reality.

### Comment 4

On the last point, sometimes the map is just oriented as things are. For example if South is up, then you are possibly facing south, you do not have to rotate the map to try to figure in what direction is actually north.

### Comment 5

All good info. We were just there in January. I'd add that mid January is an excellent time to visit. The weather is similar to Seattle and there were very few tourists. We had no trouble getting into popular attractions like Nara and the Imperial Palace with no waiting. I would add that I only needed cash to get subway tickets because I couldn't get phone app (jpass?) to work with my bank card. My wife had no trouble but I have android and she has apple. Also we have t-mobile and although it worked with wifi and we supposedly had free unlimited international data, it would not work so we had issues navigating once we left the hotel. We had to constantly find a tullies to duck into so we could get wifi. I will get a Sim card for the next trip.
