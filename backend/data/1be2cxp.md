# My fiance and I are going to Japan in less than a month. What's one regret and one special moment from your Japan trip?

For people who have been to Japan, what's the one thing you look back on that you really regret? Whether it was something you didn't take with you or something you didn't do in Japan.

Then, what's the one thing you remeber that makes you look back on your Japan trip as truly special?

Regret: not visiting smaller cities and towns. They have so much charm to offer, are less crowded, and people are so friendly. Tokyo is great and all but it’s a big metropolitan city with big metropolitan vibes. My favourite memories came from Kyushu, Kansai, Hokkaido, etc. 

Special moment: meeting all the other travellers in hostels along the way. Hiked the waterfalls in Yakushima together and ended the night with a bbq on the balcony. All night karaoke in Osaka with folks I had just met and clicked with. Onsen in Kurokawa.

Regret would be overplanning everything. I really underestimated how exhausted I would be! 

We visited Tokyo, Hakone, Osaka, Nara, Kyoto & Hiroshima in a span of 11 days. There’s so much that Japan has to offer that it’s easy to want to add everything in your itinerary, but if I could go back in the past, I would just stay in one area for the whole trip.

One thing I don’t regret doing though was staying at a ryokan. It’s pricey but it’s so relaxing and peaceful! Good way to get yourself recharged

Regret: Did not sleep well enough. Last Japan trip I mismanaged my sleep schedule and slept way too little the first week. Half the second week I had major depression episode because of lack of sleep and that sucked.

Special moment: Went to a baseball game. Japanese baseball games really are a treat. Sit in the home team section for maximum enjoyment.

Regret: Not planning enough. Turns out I'm too active and sometimes I had to think about what to do and I don't want to spend my holiday on a phone searching things. 

Special moment: If some street in Kyoto is crowded, go to the backstreet. They are so empty and much nicer.

Regret: listening to the tiktok girlies and schlepping over an hour outside of Tokyo to the Super Second Street and Book Off Super Bazaar for vintage shopping - not worth it! Don’t waste your time if you were considering this!

Most special experience was staying in a traditional Ryokan for a few nights in an onsen town and being able to soak in the hot springs and experience the beautiful culture!
