# What is worth to buy in Japan?

Hey everyone, me and my girlfriend have a question about what to buy in Japan. We're going 4 weeks to Japan and we have both a large suitcase, hand luggage and an accessory.

We are wondering what is smart to buy in japan. For example; shopping at Uniqlo is totally worth it because of the cheaper items and cheap JPY compared to EUR/USD. Are there any other gems we should look into?

If you’re from a country that has UNIQLO, MUJI or Daiso, don’t waist your time filling your suitcase with that stuff in Japan. Who cares if you save $5 on a t-shirt? Japan is the center of the fashion universe. I always bring an empty suitcase with me and fill it with all kinds of great clothes in Japan. 

If you’re looking for great men’s fashion in Tokyo, I’d recommend going to OIOI MEN (pronounced “marui”) or Isetan MEN. They are both famous department stores in Shinjuku. For women’s fashion, you have to visit 109 in Shibuya. You can also visit the regular (non-men’s) version of OIOI and Isetan for women’s fashion. Takashimaya is also another good one. 

Also, there is an area in Tokyo called Daikanyama which has all kinds of cool boutique shops (my favorite area in Tokyo). It’s kinda like the Brooklyn or Abbott Kinney of Tokyo. Shimo-kitazawa is another cool area but they mainly have vintage clothes. 

There’s also an area called “Cat Street” which is an area that focuses on street wear. 

A few Japanese brands to look out for:

- Comme ca Ism - It’s like a Japanese style Zara. 

- Porter (Yoshida & co) - They make really cool bags. Like Hershel Supply, but cooler (and pricier).  

- Mont Bell - It’s an outdoor brand like Patagonia. I think they have a big store in Shinjuku. 

I’d you’re looking for housewares, go to LoFt or Tokyu Hands. 

These are just a few ideas, but I have many more!

If you like Uniqlo then GU is similar but doesn’t have store fronts overseas yet. I bought a bunch of tshirts from them because they’re much better quality than similar priced ones in the US.

Also if you use rice scoopers, Japan makes a weighted non stick rice scooper. It’s my favorite, most useful thing I’ve gotten from Japan.
