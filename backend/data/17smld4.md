# I'm not a big shopper, but I am seeing a lot of people say it's worth shopping in Tokyo...What am I missing and how could I figure out some shopping spots before I leave in 7 days?

Don't get me wrong, I shop. However, it's never a destination or activity for me. It's a necessity thing. So, what's so special about shopping in Tokyo that makes people carve out entire days and bring extra luggage for it?

Honestly, if you’re not a big shopper and there’s nothing in particular you need or want, just enjoy your time. Finding things to buy for no reason is wasteful.

I’m a foodie so personally I’m looking forward to bringing part of Japan back home with me through cooking ingredients and snacks. I need to eat anyways so I just tell myself it’s partially a necessity? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I once saw super cool looking people come out of an elevator wearing relly amazing outfits. Me and my friend stopped at every single floor since there were no signs and went to the very top and found THE COOLEST store!!! Every time I wear a necklace or the belt with the chains, or the specific dress I always yet compliments. I  was like ok I have been missing out on so much so a lot of the times we would see where people were going and I would ask workers of the  stores where they would go. There was one thrift store I found so many designer things for less than $30. I cleaned up. Lol. Osaka was my fav place to shop.

Also "not a shopper", but I went into UNIQLO and ended up with 6-7 pairs of the same pants (in three different colors) because I loved the way they looked and more importantly felt.  


They were about $15 per pants there. Back home in the states, these same pants would run you $39.99.

Depends.

One family member filled up on anime goodies.

Another on KitKats and other Japanese snacks to bring home.

A friend had a bunch of thrifted goods and different types of instant ramen.

With the yen dropping, another friend bought some luxury goods.
