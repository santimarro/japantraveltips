# Where are the best areas in Tokyo to wander around and get lost without a plan?

First time traveler to Japan. I don't speak Japanese. One of my favorite things to do the first time I visit any city is to just walk around the city with no plans and just kind of get lost. Walk in whatever direction I feel like, people watch, listen to an audiobook, maybe pop into a cafe if it looks interesting, etc 

What area of Tokyo is the best place to do that, in your opinion?

Koenji is a neat little district. Very walkable just off the train station.

The Yanesen (Yanaka - Nezu - Sendagi) area. 

Lots of old shops, shrines, houses, a lovely old shopping street that sells great food and one of the oldest surviving coffee houses in Tokyo, Kayaba Kohii. 

Another nice thing to do is to walk from Harajuku, through the grounds of Meiji Jingu, through the back streets of Shinjuku and along the side of Shinjuku Gyoen, over to Shinjuku station.
