# Please explain Limited Express trains (before I have a heart attack)

Here is the backstory.  I bought a Thunderbird ticket from Osaka (Umeda) to Kanazawa.  At the time I thought the price seemed cheap (under 5000 yen).  The next day I went to the station and when I put my ticket into the machine the gates slammed closed.  The attendant said I needed to buy a second ticket.  After talking to multiple people who couldn’t explain what ticket I needed, I finally talked to someone with perfect English at the JR information desk.  She said I needed TWO tickets: one to reserve my seat and another that was the fare for the train.  I bought another ticket directly from her (for the exact same price as the first one) , inserted them simultaneously into the gate and just barely made my train.

Fast forward to today and I’m trying to buy a ticket from Kanazawa to Tokyo.  Scared I’m going to mess up the purchase again, I ask the attendant to help me and a SINGLE ticket pops out (not two like I needed before).  I can’t make the lady understand my questions and eventually give up trying.  Now I’m stressing out because I can already imagine the gate slamming shut tomorrow.

Can someone please explain what is going on (before my anxiety makes me go to the station two hours early tomorrow)?  Do I really only need a single ticket to get to Tokyo tomorrow?  If so, why did I need two tickets going from Osaka to Kanazawa?

### Comment 1

A limited express train requires two things: a base fare ticket and a supplement.

A base fare is just how much a normal (even hypothetical) train would cost to get there. The supplement is a ticket on top of that that allows you to take a Limited Express train (as the name implies, it’s an express train making limited stops).

In your first scenario, it sounds like you bought just the supplement (which is about 3700 yen for Osaka to Kanazawa). You still need to buy a base fare ticket.

In your second scenario, you bought a combined fare ticket - which is a single ticket that includes base fare and limited express fares all together. You’re probably taking the Shinkansen and if your ticket costs something like 14000 yen you’re fine.

Japan loves using multiple layers of tickets where other countries would just use different ticket types.

Shinkansen and limited express trains require i.) Base fare ticket, and ii.) limited express train ticket. 

A single paper ticket can contain both the base fare and limited express train ticket.

Here's a link from the JR East train company that visually explains this ticketing system - [https://www.jreast.co.jp/multi/en/ticket/guide.html](https://www.jreast.co.jp/multi/en/ticket/guide.html)

You have the option to buy both fares at the same time, therefore resulting in only one ticket. I also did this when I was going from Kyoto to Hiroshima by mistake and ended up with two tickets and not understanding why. If you look at your ticket and do a google translate, there might be itemized charges listed.

I ran into this a couple times. It's either you need a fare and seat ticket or you need a fare+supplement. The exact terminology seems to change depending on the train line.

I also used the wrong exit/transfer gates a number of times getting the same gate lock buzzer. It's jarring when it first happens because it's so unexpected from previous gate experiences. So I know what it feels like running into it.

All I can say is try not to let it stress you. For the most part, everyone was friendly and helpful in getting it fixed, even in a couple of stations where nobody spoke English.

This changes from Shinkansen to other trains as well. I have made my share of mistakes here so I learned the best is just to go with enough time to allow for extra queues and extra mistakes. For the local "express" trains, you need as others said 2 tickets, BUT the base fare *can* be paid with the usual suica and then buy the upgrade at the machines, which makes it even more confusing.

Also in a single train (only in few specific ones) you might have base-fare seats and paid seats (green car), for which I'll 100% recommend the upgrade to the green ones unless you are in a shoestring budget. You can clearly tell this though, if you see the train approaching with normal seats and then one wagon has super fancy 2-decker seats, *that's* the paid one.

For the Shinkansen, I gave up and buy the whole thing, whatever that means, at the counter on the spot and try to avoid booking in advance. Right now with the Sakura+Hanami stuff going on that might not be the best option/might delay you though.
