# What to do between 7am-10am in Tokyo?

I’m currently in Tokyo and the only things open this early I can think of is Tsukijii market and shrines. Anything else I can do early in the morning?

Konbini breakfast comparison/shopping, brewing tea/coffee, enjoying the only serenity you’ll get in Tokyo all day

### Comment 2

Senso-Ji shrine.  

Go for a run around the Imperial Palace (counter-clockwise).

### Comment 3

I honestly would go to Don Quijote and buy stuff (souvenirs or gadgets). Also, if you’re into photography, go to some nice streets to take pictures before the crowds start to get there.

Visit shrines/temples, walk around parks, get breakfast at a bakery or kissaten, read at a coffee shop (it's rare, but you can usually find at least one speciality coffee place that's open early in the bigger cities), walk around quiet city streets.

It can also be a good chance to get a jumpstart on a day trip. For instance, if you're going somewhere that's an hour or two away (for instance, Nikko from Tokyo), using those hours where there's nothing else to do to travel is a good idea.

### Comment 5

I stayed in Shibuya and jogged to Yoyogi Park and back every morning while my wife was still sleeping. Great path, not too many people.
