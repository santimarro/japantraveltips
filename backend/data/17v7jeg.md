# Husband and I sick in Kyoto. What should we do?

I hope this post is okay, I posted in a similar subreddit and the mods wouldn't allow my post. It's 2:35 AM Japan time and I'm desperate for some advice. Please be gentle.


My husband and I are on the end of our 2nd week of our 3 week trip and we both seem to have come down with *something*.


We both have horribly sore throats, dry coughing, weakness, dizziness, horrible shivering, and both have fevers. I'm up to 101.84¬∞ F. My whole body hurts. My fingernails hurt. My skin hurts.


I'm anxious being sick in a foreign country. This is our first time in Japan üò≠


I triple masked and stumbled into a pharmacy, and the sweet lady spoke a little English and gave me some meds. It looks like its mostly Ibuprofen. No cough drops or Nyquil (they probably don't have that here, right?). 


I'm worried we have Covid. We are doubled vaxxed and have never had it before, and in my fever-y haze, I'm having trouble finding testing centers near us in Kyoto. We're staying near Kiyomizu-dera.


Any advice? Should we try and get tested? We have 7 days left until we need to fly home...



Also, can I just vent? THIS SUCKS!!! 

This is our dream trip we've waiting years for and we have a Ryokan booked in 4 days. We've hardly seen Kyoto because of how sick we've felt. Has anyone else been sick on their Japan vacation? This is just so depressing. I've been SO CAREFUL; using masks, hand sanitizer constantly, washing my hands when I can, and I carry around Clorox wipes and Wet Wipes to use before and after every meal. I'm diagnosed OCD so I do these things A LOT. I haven't been sick in years...why now???? üò≠




ETA: I'm not looking for medical advice, but the tips are helpful and appreciated. Especially if you know of things specifically in Japan that could be helpful while we ride this out (like drinking Pocari Sweat, etc). I mostly wanted to see if anyone knows how I can get us to an English speaking/bilingual clinic or Covid testing facility in Kyoto if we don't improve. Also, I wanted to vent because THIS SUCKS. I've been dreaming about that Ryokan, I don't want to miss it...but we will continue to hydrate and rest.

Thanks for the comments so far ü§íüíï


Update #1: We had a rough night. Hardly any sleep. Even with Tylenol and Ibuprofen, we were just in too much pain to sleep much. We are staying as hydrated as we can. It feels like razor blades when we swallow.

Our fevers have only gone up. I'm at a 39.5¬∞ C (103.1¬∞ F), and my husband is at 40¬∞ C (104¬∞ F)



Update #2: So, turns out is *is* Covid. We just kept feeling worse and worse, and our temps got pretty high. I forgot to mention in my original post that we decided on not having phone service, thinking we didn't need it, so I wasn't able to make calls and find places easily. I ended up taking advice from a few sweet commenters, and I went down to the front desk of our hotel. The Japanese lady was SO helpful. She spoke just enough English to understand our situation and went right into action. She called a couple of local hospitals and clinics trying to find English speaking doctors who could see us. Most places were full/not taking patients, so she told me to go rest in our room and she would come up if she found anyone. She came up about 20 minutes later saying "I got you an appointment! We have to go now!" She very gently rushed us out of there, got us in a taxi she called, and she wrote out a note for us to give to the doctor/nurses to help explain our situation. She even wrote out directions for how to get to the hospital. She was so sweet and helpful, I'll never forget her kindness. We got to the hospital, and holy moly, it was nothing like the hospitals in the US. So much better, we were treated so well. Long story short, we got tested for Flu, Covid, and Strep, and I came back positive for Covid. Weirdly, my husband was negative, but he has all the same symptoms. To get us both seen, tested, and treated cost less than $200. My American self is in shock. This visit would have bankrupted us at home.

Anyways, we're super fucking sick. Dr advised that we hunker down and don't continue our journey. I'm super heartbroken about missing out on Kyoto, Miyajima, and Hakone....but I know staying here and resting is the best...we just have to come back someday.

Thanks for all the kind comments, I really appreciate the thoughtful advice! Send us good healing vibes, I'm hoping for a fast recovery so that maaaaybe we can enjoy the very end of our dream trip. Also, definitely getting boosted when we get home!

Doctor here. English isn't my first language though, so sorry if things are worded a bit weirdly. From your symptoms it sounds like it could indeed be Covid. Doesn't have to be, could be a different viral infection, but it definitely might be. If you want to know, you could check if Japan has self tests. I haven't noticed them when I was in Japan last week, but I didn't really look for them either. You could go to a drug store (there's lots of them in the big cities) and ask, use Google translate to translate to Japanese if they don't speak English well enough to understand, that usually works.

But other than that: It does sound like a virus is the most likely cause, be it Covid or anything else, so that means riding it out is pretty much the only thing you can do. Cough drops have no scientifically proven benefit and antibiotics only affect bacteria, but not viruses. Ibuprofen would indeed be your best bet to lessen the symptoms, but only take them when you need a bit of a breather. Other than that, make sure to get a lot of rest and hydrate properly. Citrus fruits high in vitamin c (like lemons or lime), especially with honey and ginger as a tea is reported to have a positive effect sometimes, but it's also not really proven. (I always like to imagine it helps though :D)

The good news is, if you give yourself some rest and make sure to hydrate, it usually starts getting better in a couple of days, especially if you're vaxxed, so chances of complications are fairly low and you might be able to take smaller walks again soon enough, so I'm willing to speculate that you'll still be able to enjoy the ryokan.

Take care, and get well soon!

I'm so sorry this is affecting your trip. I got the flu when I was at Disney a few months ago and it suuucked having to stay in the hotel room with fever and chills. I sincerely hope you feel better! 

Hopefully if you take care of yourselves now you'll at least be be feeling better in 4 days. and if not then a ryokan will be a relaxing place to chill out. 

In the meantime hydrate hydrate hydrate! you body needs lots of fluids to flush things out so you can feel better. 

At the convenience store there's some drinks I will recommend for not feeling well. One is called Pocari Sweat. It's an electrolyte drink, I personally think it tastes better than gatorade. Sort of a mild cherry taste.  

Another sports electrolyte drink is Aquarius but I've only tried Pocari sweat so I can't speak to taste. 

CC lemon is a citrusy fizzy soda drink very high in vitamin C. it's also sugary. 

Yakult comes in little tiny bottles, it's a probiotic yogurt drink. probiotics help your immune system. This is more like a shot, it's not going to hydrate you but it can't hurt to get some probiotics in your system.

I‚Äôm not a doctor, but the usual advice is to just ride it out unless your symptoms worsen. Fever that can‚Äôt be controlled or shortness of breath.  Maybe do a telemedicine visit at home.  

I don‚Äôt think the testing makes much difference.  You shouldn‚Äôt travel with a contagious flu either way. Stay wherever you are now until you‚Äôre over it.

I was in Kyoto in September and caught COVID for the very first time. While I didn't have a fever I did lose my sense of taste and smell, as well as just had really bad fatigue. One thing I would suggest is if you're staying at a hotel, ask the front desk to make some calls to pharmacies or clinics before you make your trip to those places. I say "trip" because even short walks were a trip for me with the level of fatigue I had.  The hotel can ask if the pharmacy has the medication / covid test that you need. I did not find any bilingual doctors so I had to make heavy use of Google translate. In the end, rest and lots of liquids did the trick. Also, soaking tub helped.

Note to OP: ***please don't feel bad and think you weren't careful enough***. Japan is just much more dense with people and no combination of precautions is 100% effective. I hope you are able to recover enough and enjoy the remainder of your trip. I had to sit for a Michelin 3-star meal with very limited smell and taste.

Sorry to hear that, I'm not a doctor. But I found a posting a while back about this cough medicine while in Japan.

Contac EX is a cough medicine that uses ibuprofen-based pain relief and also has some cold treatment ingredients. Most notably, it includes Dextromethorphan (DXM). For an adult, you take 2 pills 2 times per day. The dosages on the ingredients listed below are for 4 pills (a full day's worth), so divide by two to get the per dose amount.
