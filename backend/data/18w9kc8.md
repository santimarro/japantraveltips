### Comment 1

We walked over 90 miles within 12 days!

### Comment 2

20,000 to 30,000 steps per day is pretty normal.

### Comment 3

What did you use to count your steps?

### Comment 4

The per day values match up with what I had back in March, but I was there for only a week, so not as intense overall.
