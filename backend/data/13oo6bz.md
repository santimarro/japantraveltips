# Tips from my recent travel to Japan :)

So I just came back from my solo Japan trip, May 5- May 19. Here's a few tips :D  
  
1. I should NOT have brought my slippers with me. Every single hotel had them. And no, i don't mean the white bathroom ones, i mean proper room slippers.  
  
2. My JR pass went berserk for some reason and stopped working at the gate after the first shinkansen trip to Yokohama and back. I had to go to a service center, wait an hour in line and get it reissued.  
  
3. Another thing JR pass related. It's not going to work if you're changing from a metro line (and you paid with suica) to a jr line without getting out of the gates first. So be vigilant in those cases and get out with the suica, then get in again with the pass. I had this happen to me twice. Sometimes you don't need to get out to change trains in Tokyo, so be vigilant with that.  
  
4. It rained for like 8 days out of the 15 i was there. I did buy an umbrella from the conbini, but I only had 2 pairs of shoes on. 1 sandals and 1 sneakers, which were not waterproof at all. First rain was basically a typhoon and i was walking around in completely wet shoes/socks etc. So do check the weather ( i did that btw, it just changed when i got there ) And just in case, maybe bring shoes that are more waterproof so your rainy day doesn't go to waste.  
  
5. SUNSCREEN. I got burnt to a crisp the second day there, under the sun. I didn't even know i had to have sunscreen. I bought it from the nearest conbini, but they have muuuch better selections in the pharmacies. They have all kinds of cosmetics there, along with meds, ofc. They have deodorant there as well. So, to whoever needs it in Japan, that's where you can get one, guaranteed. Not every conbini has those, soo...  
  
6. Absolutely 0 trouble with using the visitjapan with 2 QR codes. Very very fast. Just screenshot the codes beforehand, as the internet (at least in Narita, i don't know about Haneda) can be a bit flimsy.  
  
7. I had pocket wifi, but that thing a lot of times had no connection. Which might be normal, i suppose, but i was alone. I could've gotten a sim card, and wouldn't have to lug around a device that i had to keep dry in rain, etc. So, if you're alone, get a sim. If you're a group, get the wifi.  
  
8. Prepare for a loooooot of walking around. My main pair of shoes were the sneakers, slip ons that are flat. They were soo bad for walking long hours. My (sport) sandals on the other hand are a bit more shapely, with a teeny heel. They felt much much more comfortable for the walks. So i recommend something that's not fully flat.  
  
9. I always had two bags with me. one small for passport/wallet, and one over the shoulder, usually for the wifi, portable battery and jacket. It's also where i put all i bought ( cos they ask if you want a bag, and that's usually another 15 or smth yen), and the trash until i found a trashcan.  
  
10. 3 main rules of Japan. Rule 1- if you see a toilet, go the toilet, doesn't matter if you want to or not. On that note, i'd like to say that every single station has a toilet ( very good toilets in fact). Every park has a toilet, and a lot of the big shrines have toilets as well. Rule 2 - if you see a trashcan, throw your trash away. Rule 3 - if you don't know where to go, follow the crowd in the same direction they are going.  
  
11. My observations on the walking...In Tokyo, Kyoto, Nara, Saitama, Yokohama (i'd assume most of Japan btw) they walk on the left. Always. It's like an unspoken sort of rule. (Comes from olden days of the samurai, but that's another story). In Osaka, it's on the right!  
If you don't know how the correct way to walk is ( without constantly bumping into people, receiving glares and getting to your destination smoothly) just follow the crowd.  
  
That's all i can think of at this moment :D If you got any questions, ask. Hopefully I can answer.

Thatâ€™s a great set of tips, thanks!

One thing about this:

> So, if you're alone, get a sim. If you're a group, get the wifi.

The wifi option is not so suitable if your group will ever split up and someone needs to get in touch with the others or go online. On our second trip we used individual SIM cards and my daughters were able to do their own thing in other parts of the city, shrine, shopping mall, etc while still being in touch in case plans changed, they needed money, etc

Of course, we all managed to travel places before mobile phones existed, so it comes down to your chosen comfort level and the convenience of everyone being online all the time.

My god the bins thing. Coming from the UK I am simply amazed at the discipline ingrained within the Japanese of dealing with and carrying their own rubbish home.
Most people here can't be bothered to walk 2 meters to put things in a bin never mind carrying it home.

Though at the same time, I saw some odd instances of bins existing but being 'closed' like a shop. So they were there you just weren't allowed to use them at that time, weird!

Thanks for confirming how the sidewalk walking in Osaka all of a sudden got confusing bc I got very used to left side walking in Tokyo ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜†

### Comment 4

thank you!  leaving in just over a week - this is very helpful :)

### Comment 5

I just couldn't understand why Osaka line up to the right on the escalator. I thought it's a Kanto vs Kansai area thing but it turned to the left one I got to Kyoto.
