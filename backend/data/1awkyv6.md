# What You Wish You Knew When You First Visited?

I have been given the incredible opportunity to travel to Tokyo from March 1st to the 9th. This just fell into my lap a few days ago and I am a bit overwhelmed trying to plan everything and learn what I need to know to have a great time on such short notice. Anything you wish you knew the first time you went to Japan? Any advice in general for someone traveling to Japan the first time is also appreciated. And is Tokyo even a good place to visit or is there somewhere better I could be spending my time?

* Pick like the top can't miss things and work from there. A common mistake is trying to jam everything and people get overwhelmed. Be flexible.
* Download : Google maps / Google Lens / Google Translate (Japanese to english offline.  Also Navitime for getting around Tokyo
   * You will get lost on the platforms or on the subway. Don't panic (just ask the station attendant)
* Get a IC card - it makes getting around alot easier (just tap & go)
* Your feet are gonna hurt (get one of those foot detox pads at the Don Quixote (big penguin mascot). You are gonna do a lot of walking
* Get a coin pouch
* Don't pack alot of clothes - there are plenty of coin laundromats
* Department stores food courts etc have clearance foods after like 7 pm\~ They are leagues better than what you find in America super markets etc and healthier too.
* Backup Battery
* Multiport USB charger + Extra Cables

Just got back from Tokyo! Here’s a random tip. You’ll see a lot of stores sell little hand towels, you should buy one. Most bathrooms don’t have paper towels! You’ll see people whip out their towels and they come in a bunch of cute designs and are sold everywhere.

I wish I ate more. I tried to curb my urge to try everything I see at food market/Street food as I thought with the other meals I'll have in restaurants, I didn't want to "gain weight". Man now that I'm back home, I keep kicking myself for being so strict with my appetite. 

So.

Eat everything please.

Tokyo is a vertical city. Google maps will get you to the building, but your destination might be in the basement or on the th 9th floor. So look up! Or down.

Use the trains everywhere.  Where ever you decide to stay, make sure you're a short walking distance from a train station.  

Make sure you have super comfortable walking shoes.  Bonus if they're slip proof (rain).

Unless you have a diet restriction, don't sweat the restaurants too much.  There will be thousands of good places to eat all along your travels.  

Check ahead of time to see if there are any special holidays or festivals on the days you are staying in whatever city you're in.  Don't wanna miss something awesome!
