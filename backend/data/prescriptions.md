# prescriptions

The short answer is: it depends.

Many prescription medications are perfectly fine to bring into the country provided you keep the amounts under the allowed limit. Others are controlled, meaning you are allowed to bring them with certain documentation and provisions. Others are prohibited entirely, meaning you cannot bring them into the country in any quantity or under any circumstances.

If your prescription is a controlled substance or you are bringing in more than the allowed amount, you will need to complete and submit a form called a Yunyu Kakunin-sho (formerly called a Yakkan Shoumei), which can now be completed online in many cases.

Individuals who have a prescription for narcotics or stimulants that fall under Japan's controlled substance law (see below for specifics) must also fill out a narcotics-specific form in addition to the Yunyu Kakunin-sho. This form is submitted to the Narcotics Control Department of the Japan Bureau of Health and Welfare.

It is important to note that there are **no exceptions** to the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law and Customs Law, no matter what your medical condition or needs may entail. So if you regularly take prescription medication, it is extremely important to verify that your medication is permissible in Japan prior to making any travel reservations.

When bringing medications to Japan, it is advised that tourists keep any pills or substances in their original packaging or bottles.

The Ministry of Health’s [official page](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/policy/health-medical/pharmaceuticals/01.html) has the information you need:

*   Descriptions of drug classes and limits  
    
*   Link to list of prohibited ingredients (without having a prescription)  
    
*   Link to narcotics/psychotropics/stimulants page, which has the list of controlled items and processes

### How do I know if my prescription medication is allowed in Japan? And what are the limits on dosages and amounts?

The [Ministry of Health’s official page](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/policy/health-medical/pharmaceuticals/01.html) has all the information and links you need to determine the category of your prescription medication.

You should first check the controlled substances lists. There are two of these. The first one is on the page linked above (section 1), and contains restricted pharmaceutical ingredients. Bringing these ingredients into Japan requires a prescription, and they cannot be brought in without proof of one.

The second place to check is the [Narcotics Control Department list](https://www.ncd.mhlw.go.jp/en/application2.html#list) (also linked above in section 4). This list covers narcotics, psychotropics, and stimulants (commonly found in ADHD medicine, sedatives, pain medications, psychiatric medications, sleep medications, and others). If your medication appears on that list, you will need to note down the category and follow the instructions on that page for how to legally import the medication into Japan. **Please note that some medications cannot be brought in under any circumstances,** most notably certain stimulants, cannabis, and heroin. If your medication is restricted per the Narcotics Control department, you’ll need both a Yunyu Kakunin-sho _and_ a Narcotics Control application to import it.

If the medication is **not** on any prohibited or restricted lists found in the links above, you can bring it in according to the limits dictated on the Ministry of Health’a page (section 1) without any sort of prior documentation or preparation.

In particular, the limits are:

*   Prescription drugs: Up to 1 month supply  
    
*   Prescription drugs for external use: Up to 24 per one item  
    
*   Injectable drugs and syringes for the drug: Up to 1 month supply (only "Pre-filled Syringe" or "Self-injection Kit")  
    
*   Other drugs, quasi drugs, and over-the-counter medication: Up to 2 month supply  
    

If you will be exceeding the limits above, you need to apply for a Yunyu Kakunin-sho.

### What is a Yunyu Kakunin-sho?

A **Yunyu Kakunin-sho** (formerly called a Yakkan Shoumei) is an import certificate specifically for certain prescription medications and over-the-counter medical drugs/devices that is issued by the Japanese Bureau of Health and Welfare. This certificate must be declared to customs, along with your medication, when you arrive in Japan.

**A Yunyu Kakunin-sho must be obtained prior to arrival in Japan**. Please give yourself ample time to receive the authorized Yunyu Kakunin-sho from Japanese officials. You should obtain your Yunyu Kakunin-sho no less than two weeks before you trip. If you have less time than two weeks, please email your application to the proper Japan Bureau of Health and Welfare office and call your local Japanese embassy or consulate for additional guidance.

A Yunyu Kakunin-sho can now be applied for online in many circumstances, and you can see Section 5 of the [official prescription medication page](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/policy/health-medical/pharmaceuticals/01.html) for the link to the online application.

### I have determined that I need a Yunyu Kakunin-sho. What do I do?

See section 5 of the Ministry of Health’s [official page](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/policy/health-medical/pharmaceuticals/01.html) for the online application. You can also contact the department via email with specific questions.

If your medication is a restricted stimulant or narcotic, remember that you also need permission from the Narcotics Control Department (see [here](https://www.ncd.mhlw.go.jp/en/application2.html#narcotics)).

### My prescription medication is a narcotic, stimulant, or psychotropic. What do I do?

As noted above, [this page](https://www.ncd.mhlw.go.jp/en/application2.html) from the Narcotics Control Department has the list of controlled substances and what to do if you need to bring one into Japan. Note that the controlled substance list uses the generic name for medication—make sure you aren’t searching for a brand name on the list. For instance, for Xanax, you have to search for alprazolam.

### What happens if I come to Japan with my prescriptions and without a Yunyu Kakunin-sho?

If you come to Japan with controlled substances or an excess of an allowed prescription without prior declaration, you are subject to having your medications confiscated. You might also be fined, deported from Japan, or jailed. While it is entirely possible that you may not be found out at all, the consequences of not properly declaring medication can be severe, and it is **not advisable to skirt laws in Japan.**

Furthermore, those who bring **prohibited** substances to Japan will be jailed immediately. Again, it is **not advisable** to take on these risks.

### Is my over-the-counter cold medicine or other medicine prohibited in Japan?

This depends entirely on the drug and its ingredients.

Many legal over-the-counter drugs sold in other countries are illegal in Japan because they contain stimulants, which are often considered prohibited substances in Japan. These are generally medicines sold to combat the symptoms of the common cold or flu.

Some of these prohibited drugs include: Tylenol Cold, NyQuil, NyQuil Liquicaps, Actifed, Sudafed, Advil Cold & Sinus, Dristan Cold, Dristan Sinus, Drixoral Sinus, Vicks Inhaler, and Lomotil.

Please compare the active ingredients in your medication to the prohibited and controlled substance lists above to verify if your over-the-counter drug is permitted in Japan.

If your over-the-counter medication contains no controlled ingredients, then you can bring up to a 2 month supply without any additional paperwork or requirements.

### Can I bring my ADHD medication to Japan?

If your medication contains a stimulant, it is highly likely that it is prohibited in Japan or controlled in some way. This is covered under the [Narcotics Control Department’s page](https://www.ncd.mhlw.go.jp/en/application2.html) and [FAQ portion at the bottom](https://www.ncd.mhlw.go.jp/en/application2.html#faq) contains clarifying information. As of right now, Adderall is completely prohibited, but Vyvanse is allowed with advance permission. Please search the controlled substances list for other ingredients.
