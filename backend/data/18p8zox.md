I haven't done a ton but I thought Nara from Osaka was great.

### Comment 2

Nara, from Kyoto. Kamakura, from Tokyo.

Kinosaki Onsen from Kyoto. Breakfast on an early express train for a longish scenic ride. Cute town, fun ropeway with nice views, variety of nice Onsens (I did 4), crab for lunch, zone out on the return train.  Also, didn’t see any other western tourists there on a weekday in late August, if that’s a feature for you.

I lived in Osaka for 3 years and used to take dates to Kobe because it’s easy to get to and there’s a lot to do. 

I’d take the train to Sannomiya and start things off in that area. Then walk along the shotengai (shopping street) toward Motomachi Chinatown. There’s a place in the center of Chinatown that sells nothing but these small dumplings and it has a *very* long line but they are delicious. 

Then, either walk (or take a short train ride) to Kobe station. There’s an area called Mosaic right by the water that has a bunch of shops, restaurants and a giant Ferris wheel. I usually used to time things so we get there just as the sun goes down because it’s very pretty at night. After that, you can hop on the train from Kobe and head back to Osaka (Umeda).

Tokyo - kamakura , hakone , Yokohama 
, Sendai , mount takao for hiking 

Osaka - Nara, kobe connected with arima onsen, himeji 

Kyoto - Nagoya for the ghibli Park, Nara too
