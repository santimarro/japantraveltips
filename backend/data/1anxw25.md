# What do you regret buying from Japan?

Any impulse purchases? Anything whose quality didn't live up to expectations? Any overrated food places or tickets to somewhere?

Return ticket to home.

Some times you just need to calm down at the 7-11.

Umbrella

What I got in Japan was so good that has ruined me for any umbrella that I can buy in North America. I lost mine a few years ago and had to go back to Japan to buy it again because I forgot what the brand was. Now that I have it again, I can probably buy it online if I lose it again.

Edit: Since people are asking, the brand is called [Mabu](https://www.mabuworld.co.jp). I found it at Hands.

I bought a t-shirt that I wasn't allowed to take out of the package. I'm a medium in pretty much everything but medium in Japan is like a small in North America.

### Comment 5

Pok√©mon Cafe. Was extremely underwhelming with cafeteria food.
