# First Time in Japan. Experiencing Social Anxiety for the First Time in my Life. How to Stop Feeling Like a Burden/Inconvenience? Can Someone Put Me at Ease?

Hello, I hope this finds you well!

I find myself so nervous to interact with others in any capacity. I have been here two days, and on my first day I went to a ramen place and didn't know about the ticket machine when there was a huge line. They asked me in Japanese for my ticket, and all I could say was チケット? To which they tried to explain the machine and then had me follow them and helped me put money in and they pointed to the food like I was 5, and I felt really bad for holding things up and kept apologizing. 

I took 2 years of Japanese in college and can type/read a decent amount of stuff, but interacting with a native for the first time was crazy and I didn't understand a thing lol

The next morning, I was in Akihabara because it happened to be 10 mins from my hostel and I was waiting for check in at my hotel in Asakusabashi, and I didn't go into any stores and felt constantly in the way. It was SOOOO packed. Especially with my bag on my back I just stayed out of the way as much as possible because I didn't wanna get in the way or not be able to navigate a cafe/store due to my terrible speech ability. 

There was a cool guy building coils for his vape on the bench I was at at one point, and I wanted to compliment it/his mod since it was a beautiful silver one, especially because nobody really builds coils or uses mech mods in America anymore and I used to do it all the time (and do tricks/competitions and such, cringe I know) but was afraid to annoy him so I didn't talk. 

Similarly, I went to a cat cafe and the owner was amazing—they spoke very good english and even talked in some Japanese with me, but I was really nervous to interact. He kept bringing cats to me and asking where I was from and stuff but I was so embarrassed/trying to lay low and not be an inconvenience so I barely responded which I regret now. I really liked that place and the guy who ran it. 

Luckily I found another ramen place near my new hotel where i knew how to use the ticket machine and get food/drinks but I still didn’t speak at all other than ありがとうございますとごちそうさまでした because I was nervous lol. 

I'm pretty outgoing in America and never really expected this to be a side of me but I am so scared of people disliking me, or me being a burden or inconvenience. Even when I do speak my limited Japanese I feel like a 3 year old and it is super unnatural. 

Can anyone provide reassurance/tips on how to just go out and be myself?

Riding the trains wasn't too bad but even that was kinda anxiety inducing when they were packed at aki; I just stood with my bag between my legs. 

Thank you very much for your time; I hope you have a wonderful day!

You guys are taking things waaay to serious in Japan FORREAL. As long as you dont act like a total dick there is no need to overthink everything to this degree. Just act normal man. Dont smalltalk with strangers, but if it feels natural to have a conversation, then speak. These people in Japan are humans just like anyone else, they dont give a fuck as long as you act civilized and dont go out of your way to disregard all the social norms. If you feel that your backpack is in the way, carry it in your hand, or hang it on your chest instead, its really not that deep.

First time foreign traveler scare, it happens to everyone. When I was I Japan, I was so scared to use my Japanese and I felt like a moron. This was before smart phones so I had to rely on what I learned in class. I’m really bad with kanji so I felt illiterate the whole time. What I suggest is you be kind to yourself and accept you’ll have a social faux paus or two. Use Google translate on your phone to help translate and communicate. Show them your phone of what you want to ask and they can use your cell phone or their cell phone to translate what they want to say. Worked for me in France when I didn’t know any of the language.

Keep practicing your Japanese when you can though in Japan! This will be a way better learning experience than any class! You’ll be surprised how fast you’ll catch up if you just keep going and accepting the mistakes along the way. By the time I left Japan the first time, I could have a full on basic conversation.

Studying a language in school and being immersed around natives is way different. Cut yourself some slack and just enjoy yourself. Nobody expects you to be perfectly fluent and people are very accommodating generally speaking

I went through the same thing in a different country (China) and it stressed me so much. With Japan I know my Japanese is ass because I studied so long ago. But at the same time Im just more focused on doing things than 'my skills' so it doesn't bother me

Also its a big giant city with a fuck ton of people. Youre not the first foreigner theyve seen and not the last either. Buildings, aisles and roads are crowded. It just is what it is nobody cares unless youre going out of your way to be a jerk

You're in Japan for a finite period of time. Cast off that anxiety - you'll never meet any of these people again. You are not the first awkward foreigner they've met and they'll meet plenty more! Just knowing a little bit shows you put in at least some effort. 

School learning is different from in the fire. Do you have a few basic phrases ready? This is your opportunity to improve, your one shining moment.

Breath and give yourself credit. It's an anxious experience, but you're in a rare opportunity to travel (I assume) to a cool and interesting country. It's your time to have fun and enjoy yourself! And slipping up, not understanding, 'failing ' is okay!
