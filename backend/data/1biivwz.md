# Having a miserable time finding restaurants in Kyoto

Having a miserable time finding restaurants

Wife and I are 5 days into a 3 week trip, currently in Kyoto, and can't for the life of me figure out the restaurant situation. I have a Google Maps full of pins of restaurants that I understand not to take reservations but when we get there at 5 or 6 they're full. So we wander around searching and only finding chains. It's nearly a week and we've had one really good tonkatsu meal, everything else has been just fine and taken ages to find.

When I look at restaurants to make reservations they're all super fancy or super expensive or both and I really just want the experience I've been reading about on Reddit: loads of restaurants you find one with a line and wait twenty minutes. I feel a bit misinformed, because when we do find a cluster of restaurants they all end up being full for the night so we wander until it's late and we're irritable. Went to a ramen place tonight that had given out all its tickets by 5:30--what's the secret to know these kinds of things?

EDIT: Thanks for all the help! Going to make some reservations for today and tomorrow and pick some spots to go right at opening. Appreciate all the help. Special shout out to /u/catwiesel who answered my DM and helped fix my itinerary!

EDIT II: Went to a soba place near kinkaku ji right when it opened and had the best duck and the best soba of my life. We are so back! Thanks again for all the help

Depending upon where you are in Kyoto (and this applies to other parts of Japan, too), most department stores have one or two floors of restaurants at the top of the building.

Most department stores will also have a section on the ground (first) floor or basement floor that sells pre-prepared meals. The quality is typically very good and there’s a much wider variety of food compared to convenience stores. The same applies to supermarkets, which will always have a section that sells fresh, pre-prepared meals and, again, will have a larger variety than convenience stores.

Also, when looking for restaurants, don’t just look at street level. There are lots of restaurants downstairs or upstairs. Some buildings will have a few floors of restaurants upstairs and perhaps down in a basement (B1) level, too. 

Don’t be afraid to head down a side street or to look on a street parallel to the main street. If you head slightly off the beaten track, you’re more likely to find a less crowded place.

Also, if a restaurant is full when you look in, you can always wait a short while for a table to open up. I refuse to join a long queue of people, but if there’s only a couple of people waiting, or no one else waiting, then you shouldn’t have to wait long for a table.

I mean... what do your pinned restaurants consist of? If it's filled with spots you found from reddit and other tourist reccs, or spots that are \~4.5 and such on Google, those will always lean more "already discovered and overcrowded" if you're constantly getting turned away. 

As others have mentioned, this really shouldn't be an issue unless you're purposely going to spots that are regarded as highly recommended online. Yes, Kyoto is more prone to turning folks away due to how tiny some of the restaurants are, but you 100% shouldn't be like, getting turned away so much that you're going without dinner lol.

where is your hotel located?

I NEVER had an issue finding a place to eat. NEVER.

However, I dont look in google or tablelog, I just walk around and go in when it looks good and I am hungry. And I dont go looking for food when I cant move due to hungry tourists.

Send me a pm, Ill try to steer you to some places for tomorrow

I sometimes take a leisure walk between destinations and stumble upon interesting eats/cafes along the way. Then I’ll check to see the reviews on Google maps to see if it’s worth saving and circling back to another day.

Another trick is to eat at a restaurant that you enjoy and if it’s not too busy + the owners seem like the chatty/approachable sort, I’ll apologise and ask them if they can recommend some places that they enjoy eating at. It’s a good way to immediately land on some really interesting places. 

You can also ask your hotel receptionist if they have places they like to eat at. That might be a good way to get you started.

I once signed up for a cooking class and the teacher happened to be a local food editor so she was more than happy to recommend loads of places to eat at.

Japan is a place that rewards curiosity and politeness! Have fun!

One tip I picked up on YouTube was — if you want to look for a ramen restaurant, don’t type “ramen” (in English) into google maps… use google translate and type the Japanese word for ramen — “**ラーメン**” — and you will get better results from google maps… including more places that locals visit.
