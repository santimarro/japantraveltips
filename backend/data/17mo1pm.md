# Favourite purchase (unique) from Japan?

I'm going to Japan soon in February.

What gifts/purchases were your favourites? Better answers for those items that are uniquely Japanese

i got a lot of snacks and charms for my parents but my dad's favorite souvenir that i got for him was this random tiny wooden spoon that i bought on a whim while walking around miyajima. He uses it everyday for his coffee/tea and my mom is still mad at me to this day for not buying tiny wooden spoons for the whole family lol

I bought a fan from kyoto, but it was only when I used it that I realised that the wood had a light scent to it. It's probably the poshest thing I have in my house, I feel like some high born noble using it LOL.

Grand seiko, and apparently made in Japan nail clippers

Edo period ukiyoe woodblock prints. If you’re not picky about condition, then original authentic works can be had relatively cheaply (like under $100 USD).

Also contemporary calligraphy. Walked by a mini exhibition of works by students for charity and bought a nice little piece.

Matcha whisk!! 

(And matcha powder. Oh, and a matcha bowl. Then you need a matcha spoon. A container for said matcha powder. A whisk holder. And so on…..).
