# Older Japanese man asked to take a picture with me, is this normal?

I‚Äôm a 33 year old white dude from Los Angeles. Yesterday I took a day trip to Kamakura and while on a train to Enoshima island, an older (I‚Äôd say at least in his 60s or 70s) Japanese man approached me and in broken English asked to take a picture with me. At first I thought he asked if I‚Äôd take a picture OF him like with his wife or something but when I looked at him confused, he pointed at his phone and tried asking again. I laughed and said sure and then he put the phone in a selfie position and we both smiled and he took a picture, then he shook my hand and said have a nice day. It felt bizarre in the moment and as an anxious person, I kind of got in my head and started asking myself it that was a scam of sorts but what kind of scam could he have possibly been running by just taking a picture? Maybe he‚Äôs just into white foreign dudes lol? Anyone have similar experiences like this?   

Edit: Well, the people in the comments have spoken, apparently this is very normal lol. However, I refuse to let my ego dissolve and will continue to believe this man thought I was a gorgeous celebrity. üòå

My BIL was an English teacher in a small town and he was regularly on the evening news because ‚Äúwhat does tall gaijin have to say about this?‚Äù

### Comment 2

It actually is fairly normal. I know it seems strange and suspicious but it was almost certainly innocent.

It's normal. You might resemble a celebrity to him -- not that he thinks you *are* one, but the resemblance is enough. Or you might just be tall, or have blond hair. And sometimes Japanese just ask for photos with foreigners for fun. It's a relatively common cultural thing.

FYI, after he takes a picture of you two, you should take a selfie with him too.  Enjoy!
