# Should I go out to explore Tokyo during a 6 hour layover?

Hello, I (female) am looking for advice from knowledgeable individuals who can tell me if itâ€™s possible/worth it to go out of Haneda Airport to the Shibuya area during a 6 hour layover. 

I will be landing in Haneda at 6:45pm and my departure is at 00:35am at Terminal 2. 

If you do recommend me to go out, do you have any tips or suggestions for me to save my time (example if I should avoid any areas or if there are specific restaurants with fast and good service?)

Fyi, this will be my first time in Japan ever, and I hold a Canadian passport.

Lol no. You will be going through customs, so add 2-3 hours to that. In reality, you only have like... 3 hours at most. Stay at the airport and explore it.

### Comment 2

Like others said, there is not enough time for you to actually go to Tokyo, but Haneda Airport is great and has lots to offer. And the food is really good there too.

### Comment 3

probably not.  It will be a hassle especially if you're not familiar with the transportation there.  Just explore the gift shops, grab a bunch of souvenir snacks and grab a meal.  The airport food is actually really good there compared to other airports.  The meal on your flight will probably suck too so grab some takeout while you're there

Not worth it.  Haneda has a bunch of shops outside security.  Go find a nice restaurant/bar.

I recommend the sushi place, the green tea ice cream place from Ito-en, and the slot car racing place on the top floor. :)

Stay at the airport. At least Japanese airports don't jack up prices on everything by a large margin.
Shibuya Station is already a labrynth and with all the construction going on.
