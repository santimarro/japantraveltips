# Recently bought tax free in Japan, did I do something wrong?

Hello!
A few weeks ago my fiancée and I spent a week in Japan, and we did a fair amount of shopping. Mainly clothes and video game stuff. Every time we used our passports for the tax free treatment we were instructed to hang onto our receipts/take screenshots of purchases. I was under the impression that leaving the country we would then present those, but nobody asked. Similarly, when we got back to the United States, customs asked us what all we brought back, nothing unapproved of course, but similarly didn’t ask for anything (I chalked it up to us having a tight connection). I guesstimate the amount we saved on tax to be a few hundred, nothing too crazy but we did try to use it as much as possible.

It obviously doesn’t affect me now that I’m home, but we’re planning going back later in this year, and I’m paranoid that once we arrive at customs, we’ll run into trouble in the event we made a mistake when we were leaving. Is this a realistic concern, and if so, what do I need to do in order to straighten things out?

You get the tax free price at the register, and everything is subject to inspection at the border exit, but it’s not often done.

Tax free works a bit differently in Japan than it does in places like Europe. There are a few scenarios

1. Most of the time the tax is taken off at the tmie of purchase. Your receipts will show your purchase was tax free. You basically don't have to do anything to recover your tax
2. In larger department stores, you will be instructed that your purchase includes tax. Then you generally go to the tax free kiosks they have on one of the floors to claim your tax back.
3. Some places like DonQuiote take your tax free purchases and then seal them in red bags like they're biological waste. You're 'technically' not supposed to consume or open them until you leave the country

Theoreticaly: you're supposed to show all those receipts to the customs officer when you are leaving japan to show your purchases in yoru luggage are tax free.

Reality : sort of no one actually cares in the airports about this. You're supposed to show them to the customs officer when you leave if you get searched. Again this seems to almost never happen though. You didn't do anything wrong really. Its just that the system is extremely lax and mostly self-reporting.

Future: Japan seems to be realizing that this "we dont care about tax free" thing seems to be letting a lot of money out of the country where people are doing so for reselling. So there is talk about revamping the system to be more in line with what you might experience in Europe.

US side: note US customs doesn't actually care about if you got something tax fee in Japan. US customs cares about import duties. When entering the US you have an allowance of how much you can bring in duty free (this is NOT TAX FREE). You are allowed $800 duty free into the USA. So say you bought a Macbook tax free in Japan for the equivalent of $1500. Yes you got that tax free, but its not duty free. As such you owe duties on the $700 remainder to US customs.

The QR code seems to be mostly a convenience thing for the retailers to input your information. I found literally only one store, Uniqlo Ginza, that even understood what the QR code was.

It's a de facto honor system. There's no amount of manpower that would allow them check that all tax-free purchases are leaving the country. If they tried, the airport would slow to a crawl as Chinese women unpacked all their tax-free cosmetics bound for resale on taobao for the customs officers to examine. I've never handed in receipts or scanned anything over a hundred visits, even in the times when they stapled receipts into your passport.

Entering the US is also basically an honor system. CBP officers will pull people out based on their own internal policies for inspection. But they don't have any jurisdiction or care for Japan duty-free since it's not their issue. They're looking for contraband or undeclared items.

So i did it the official way at Narita. Right by security there’s a literal buzzer. You press it and someone asked if i was taking out over a million yen. I said no. They said no need for inspection. 

They could have decided to depending on their day, but they didn’t take my name or anything. So it seems highly
Unlikely it matters for less than a mil

I just left from NRT yesterday and likewise bought a lot of tax free stuff in multiple purchases and had them all packed for inspection. About 10 yards before immigration there was a customs desk to the side. We asked the officer about tax free and she had us scan both our passports to see if further steps were needed. They weren’t so she sent us along. I’m assuming there’s a record of our checking in with customs on exit but I also think the machine was pretty inconspicuous and a lot of people probably miss this step.
