# Cost of traveling in Japan.

Just came back from two weeks in Japan and I have to say it was cheaper than I expected. Overall spent 3k per person for two weeks, which is comparable to a week on a cruise ship.

Food is cheaper than NY by far. I love the three dollar meals in sukiya and often order more cause of the low price. Fell for the AYCE tourist trap cause it isn't really AYCE. We still ate like kings tho.

Anyone have similar experience about how affordable your experience was?

Itâ€™s easy in Japan to spend as much as you want to spend. The high end gets really high really fast. 

But a lot of the lower end is very reasonable and often very satisfying. Only takes a couple of delicious $8 bowls of ramen to bring the average meal price down dramatically.

My only gripe is the plane tickets.

I actually expect my upcoming 10 day stay in Tokyo, as a break from high inflationary prices going ballistic here in Los Angeles.

One thing to keep in mind it feels so much affordable because you're spending USD which is very strong right now. If you were spending something like AUD you would be spending quite a bit more.

Absolutely. I thought it was going to be an expensive trip. As the trip went on, I was getting used to the USD to Yen conversion realizing how cheap everything was. My wife and I got shabu shabu to find out it was $50 all you can eat meat. If we got that in the states, easily $100+ meal before tip. The other night we ordered takeout because of jet lag. God damn, it was expensive compared to a similar sized meal in Japan! Japan spoiled us with the cheap meals lol. 

We came back a few days ago and I already miss Japan.
