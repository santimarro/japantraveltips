# For those that’ve been to Japan more than twice…

…what’re the popular places to visit that you just haven’t been able to check out yet.

I’ve gone twice in the last two years and still haven’t seen Mount Fuji (aside from the view from a Tohoku Shinkansen lol) or (Shinjuku) Gyoen National Park.

How about you? Super popular places in Japan but you just haven’t gotten around to going.

Lake Kawaguchiko.

Supposed to be spectacular.  They even have some nice [reservation only trains with gourmet desserts](https://www.fujikyu-railway.jp/fujisan-view-express/en/) you can eat while watching the scenery go by.

Or you can just go with the [touristy groups out of Shinjuku station](https://www.jrailpass.com/blog/fuji-excursion-train).

Been to Japan quite a few times, but something always comes up to prevent me from going. Either lack of time, or reservations are full.

Don't try to do everything in one visit. Do the things you do well/longer... Are you going there to cross it off list, or experience it.

Don't knock non-touristy things, you will see more surprises and in some people's views, a more authentic snapshot of Japanese life.

Last of all, having things you still yet to do, will give you another reason to return.

"Been there done that" vs "Oh I wouldn't mind seeing that on a future trip"

I didn’t get to summit mt fuji until my 5th trip to japan. I’ve been to 5th - 8th station on my second trip but it wasn’t climbing season. 

Didn’t go to kinkakuji and fushimi Inari until my 2nd trip to kyoto.

### Comment 4

Been to Japan 10 times and have visited tourist-popular places like Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Hiroshima, Nagoya, Okayama, Hakata, Sendai, Sapporo, Hakodate

We bought 21 day pass before the price rise and returning this December. Our plan is to visit some of the above places plus new ones like Niigata, Morioka, Kagoshima, Nagasaki, Arashikawa

Disclaimer: our trips are food-focused with a just bit of sight-seeing hence we don’t usually go to very remote places

### Comment 5

I’ve been more than two dozen times, and I’ve never been to Hakone. We do like Kawaguchiko a lot, though, and have been multiple times.
