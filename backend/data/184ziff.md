# I need to know the situation with animal cafes in Tokyo

Can someone shed a bit of light on these cafes? As I’m planning my trip I was considering visiting one but at the same time I’m getting an ick feeling about it. I like the idea but how ethical are they really?

Edit: I get the dislikes but I’m not condoning unethical businesses, I want to be educated on this hence why I’m asking. 

Update: Okay I feel ill. Thank you to everyone who has responded and have given me insight. I’m so disappointed that these cafes exist and are real tourist traps that are at the expense of an animal’s wellbeing. I appreciate the cafes out there that are focused on adoption, but as someone has mentioned there is an abundance of things to do and see and these cafes will very much be a hard pass for me. Now that I have this information I can pass this onto others. Thanks again :)

I went to a hedgehog cafe and immediately felt bad afterwards. They were extremely sleepy and irritable to the point the one I was holding tried to squirm and fall out of my hands.

Animal welfare is seen very differently in Japan compared to the west. You’ll often see animals placed in unnatural, uncomfortable, or even inhumane conditions, down to their treatment, caging, and breeding practices - all for the sake of money and entertainment. These kinds of cafes are still sadly extremely popular so they’re incentivized to continue their practices. I think the fewer people that patronize these businesses the better, and hopefully someday these places will be gone. I’ve been hoping it’s improved but in my last several visits I saw a monkey chained by its neck forced to perform on a stage at an onsen and alligators kept in cages the same size as their bodies. 

I’m glad to see visitors like you asking about it to learn more! Hopefully this message can reach more people.

Highly recommend Yadorigi Cafe. It's a cat cafe doubling as adoption service. I went yesterday and they had 23 cats running around. Owners speak english very well.

Most of them are unethical and cruel and I’d say to be safe avoid them like the plague.

I think cat cafes should be fine if they are done right. Cats are used to humans, and as long as they have some places away from humans, it should be fine. The one I went to was really quiet. The cats could roam around freely and go to places not reachable by humans. Other animals like owls I would avoid.
