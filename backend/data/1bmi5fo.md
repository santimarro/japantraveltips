# Things I wish I knew before going to Japan first time

I just came back from few weeks in Japan and this subreddit and the parent one were very helpful for my preparation, so I would like to also contribute my tips and what I wish I knew.

**Preparation**

It's good to prepare and I can really recommend the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/faqs/japantravel/) here and [japan guide](https://www.japan-guide.com/) for starters. I think most people including me tend to make a really ambitious itinerary, so my advice would be to rather treat it as a wishlist - you will definitely see less things than you planned but also some new things which you just encountered on the way. We had three lists on Google maps (Sightseeing, Eating, Shopping) and depending on how we felt on the day, we visited some of the places we saved there. Definitely do your research on things you really want to see that require reservations in advance, and also check when they are open. A lot of places tend to be closed on Tuesdays, but also random other days. Note their opening hours too, many shops and restaurants tend to open only around 9:30 and close by 17:00. These late opening hours mean it's a good idea to plan for the morning a place which doesn't require employees to be present, like hiking or visiting temples that don't have tickets. Or just sleep longer, you are on vacation after all! :)

Try to have as flexible schedules as possible (which means less booked activities during the day) so that you can go along with the weather. When it rains you can focus on shopping activities, museums and other things indoors (or go see popular places which will be less crowded in bad weather). When it's sunny you can do longer outdoor activities including hiking. And when you're tired you can just relax. So try to not tie yourself to always having to be at a certain place and time.

The season when you are visiting in Japan has a huge impact. For us, visiting in early March meant some places weren't that nice as they would be with the Sakura blossoms or Autumn foliage. But it was a great time to see the most popular sights as the crowds were okay. For example the Arashimaya bamboo forest at 8:30 am was almost empty, which I understand is not the case in busier times of the year. Around 10-11 am it was packed though. The queues to restaurants were surprisingly short too.

So keep this in mind when reading other people's trip reports because if you visit on a different time of the year than them, your experience won't be the same.

Definitely prepare the QR code via registering on the [Visit Japan website](https://services.digital.go.jp/en/visit-japan-web/), it's really simple and it will make your journey through immigration faster.

Having internet is absolutely key, I bought and installed the Airalo e-sim ahead of flight, it worked immediately upon arriving in Japan. Alternative options exist too.

I also recommend watching some movies to have better understanding of Japan plus you'll see some nice movie locations that you can be excited about visiting in real life later. We learned a lot about Japanese food from the documentary [Tsukuji Wonderland](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3772612/) and we learned about Kyoto and the Geisha life from the Netflix series [The Makanai: Cooking for the Maiko House](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3772612/). It was also cool seeing places from the movies [Your name](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5311514/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk) and [Suzume](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16428256/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk) in Tokyo. One movie I won't recommend is [Lost in Translation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335266/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk), might be a good movie on its own but Japan is just in the background here.

Lastly I encourage you to make your trip to Japan your own one. Definitely go see some popular places, they are popular for a reason, but don't just follow the highlights from somebody else's trip report or Instagram reel. Japan is so big, that everyone will find something for themselves. Do you like hiking? Find a nice trail in the mountains away from the crowds. Do you like live music? Find a concert happening nearby. Do you love tea? Book a tea ceremony or matcha making workshop (we've done both). You will most likely remember these experiences and not all the temples and shopping streets. For example, we are climbers and found out there is a local climbing competition in Tokyo, which was super amazing - hype crowd and strong climbers competing including a duo heading to the Paris Olympics.

**Getting around**

People say this in every report but I will repeat: do get comfortable and well cushioned shoes. Even if you are a seasoned runner / hiker, you will spend so much time walking on a hard paved surface. I have seen a desparate lady in *Daiso* on a rainy day in Kyoto, looking to buy new socks and shoes because her Converse shoes weren't doing so well.

Surprisingly few people talk about using bikes for transport. These are amazing if you want to explore an area and your feet hurt from all the walking. Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo are very bike friendly with flat terrain and lots of cycling paths. You can either rent a bike from a store (but then you have to return it later at the same place), or use a sharing app such as *LUUP* (I had great experience with it) or *PiPPA*. Often times the bikes are electric which makes biking a breeze. Just don't try to bike like the locals, because they seem to break a lot of rules: riding on the sidewalk at reckless speed and parking their bike wherever convenient.

The IC card Suica/ Icoca is amazing, especially when you have an iPhone where it's all digital including top-up. But even the physical card is worth it (which you need to get if you have an Android), as it makes travelling very easy - you don't need to spend time buying tickets on a machine at the station. Just load up your cash at a machine and then tap the card getting in and out of a station.

The subway and rail network can get confusing with so many different lines, but the card works everywhere in them which is good. Transferring between two lines can be simple but in bigger cities can get very difficult. Try to always follow the signs above your head in combination with Google maps hints, and expect you will sometimes get lost and lose time.

Booking train tickets online is a super frustrating process, for a European close to impossible - the SmartEx app is not available and when I tried on the webpage, it won't accept any of my cards which seems to be a common occurrence. So the best bet is doing it on a machine at a train station. If you want the best seats on Shinkansen (sitting together, with view of Mt. Fuji…) it's a good idea to book in advance. We were buying a ticket five day in advance for Kyoto - Tokyo and the morning trains had almost all the good seats booked.

Luggage forwarding is a must. I've seen so many people struggle with their luggage on the streets and frequent stairs. For example how we used luggage forwarding: On Thursday morning we brought the luggage to one of the branches of the company *Yamato Transport* (sometimes your hotel can do this for you). We filled a form with our details, the address of our next hotel, and handed over the luggage. We had a small backpack with things we needed for the rest of Thursday and Friday. Next day on Friday we went to Tokyo, left out backpack at a small coin locker and explored the city. Then picked it up again, checked-in the hotel and our luggage forwarded through the service was already waiting in our room.

Coin lockers are an amazing thing but they tend to totally fill up at he train station. Usually you can find other coin lockers in google maps that are nearby, and they are much emptier. Feel free to ask staff (e.g receptionist for office building) for directions as sometimes the lockers are hard to find tucked somewhere in a corner.

**Food and Drinks**

You have endless dining options in Japan, and it's all good food, so pick whatever you want and most probably you'll be happy. Don't go just to places with a queue - chances are you will find something nearby which will be just as good. I recommend trying a mix of everything Japanese - conveyor belt sushi, a famous chain restaurant (*Ichiran, Gyukatsu Motomura*...), local fastfood (*Ootoya, Sukiya, Matsuya* ... ) a food court in the shopping mall, an Izakaiya, a small local place and an Omakase. I am not a fan of eating a foreign cuisine (Western, Korean, Chinese...) but if you want to, there are very good options too and it's nothing to be ashamed of.

Kombinis have ridiculously good food too (sandwiches, dumplings, fried chicken....), whenever you are on a timer, you can have a good meal there. Especially good for breakfast when most cafes are still closed. The same applies for Bento box shops, you should try it at least once.

You don't have to worry about carrying around enough water, because you can fill it up at the many public toilets no problem. And also use the vending machines, they really are anywhere, sometimes even on top of a mountain haha. They usually have a wide selection of cheap hot and cold drinks. You can usually pay with your IC card, sometimes only cash.

**Speaking Japanese**

You can definitely get around without knowing any Japanese - the *Google lens / Google translate* app can reliably translate menus, signs, or anything else written. In touristy areas there are usually explanations in English too.

When you need to ask somebody for help, I found it very effective approaching them, saying Sumimasen and showing them what I wrote on my phone translated to Japanese. Showing pictures I googled was highly effective too if I was looking for some specific product. Everyone is very helpful as long as you are polite, and I had only pleasant interactions.

You should make an effort to at least learn basic words. I often used:

Excuse me - Sumimasen

Sorry - Gomenasai

Please - Kudasai

Thank you very much- Arigatou gozaimasu

Water - Mizu (better to say Omizu if you order at restaurant)

Rice - Gohan

Tasty - Oishi

**Tourists**

Some places are definitely suffering from over-tourism, especially Kyoto. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't go, just try to visit the touristy places outside of the busiest hours. Also try not staying on the one overcrowded street but wander around, suddenly there is nobody. E.g. we went on a side-trail to *Fushimi Inari*, there were tori gates too, but haven't seen a single living soul. Will post more details separately with my itinerary. Then we got to the main area and it was totally packed.

Be respectful to the locals, following the rules where to eat, where to not take pictures etc. If you're not sure, just ask.

I've seen a lot of bad behavior from the "Insta influencers" who want to take a good picture no matter what - holding up the flow of people walking, jumping into car traffic or stepping on sacred places they shouldn't. It's gotten so bad that some places like the Lawson store in Kawaguchiko with Mt. Fuji in the background has a [guy policing the crowds taking pictures](https://imgur.com/zNqppxp) so that cars can pass by. Just don't be like these people.

My craziest experience was seeing a spanish guy in Kyoto who jumped in front of a bus that just left from a stop, and tried to ask the bus driver for directions, showing him his tiny phone screen from 5 meters away. Absolutely ridiculous.

A funny one was when a kid got his mouth dirty with chocolate and his dad tried to force him to wipe it with a napkin he wetted in a muddy puddle on the path. Understandably the child protested. The old japanese shopkeeper, seeing this theatre unfold, offered clean water (saying *Mizu*), but the dad didn't understand and kept chasing the poor boy with his muddy napkin. Finally the kid was rescued by the shopkeeper and the dad said *Arigatou* with the most American pronunciation possible (a – rig – a – toe).

**Locals**

We had a lot of pleasant interactions, here are some of our highlights:

At the metropolitan government buildings we started speaking with Japanese school kids from Niigata who came on a one day trip to the big city. Their English was limited but it was super interesting learning about their life, how the school is, and their ambitions. They also borrowed charged our phones with their powerbank which was so nice of them.

In a bar on *Omoide Yokocho* a Japanese couple asked us with Google translate whether we are enjoying Japan. Through our phones we managed to have a pretty good conversation, the guy was a monk and was impressed by our goshuin collection. He joked he can draw us one at the bar using leftover sauce ahaha.

At an Omakase, we sat next to an older man, who kindly helped explain some items from the menu. Later on it turned out he is the CEO of a Japanese bank. He was so nice and humble!

We watched people play Karuta at the *Omi Jingu* and afterwards, one of the players approached us. Turns out he is the only foreigner in the whole Japanese Karuta association. He's from Indonesia studying in Kyoto (seems quite a few Indonesians do this). We spoke about Karuta, his passion for the sport and how it's super competitive here.

We went to a really small eatery in a village. It was ran by a Japanese grandma who was really surprised to see foreigners. She kept saying something, but unfortunately I didn't understand except for few words. I pointed on two things on the menu hanging on the wall, using all body language I could muster that we want one of this and one of this. She seemed she understood and later brought two absolutely delicious sets of homemade meals. Then she kept coming back checking in on us if we like the food which was really sweet of her. She spoke some more Japanese and was laughing about my response attempts.

**Random observations:**

The Japanese gesture for *no / it's not available here / we are full* are crossed hands. Don't take it as a rude gesture, that's just how it looks in Japan instead of e.g shaking your head.

Japanese like to follow rules, which is in general a good thing. It was funny though when I've seen them wait on red lights even for walking across small side streets with zero traffic. People were coming in from these side streets and freely crossed to the sidewalk of whichever side they wanted, but if you stood on the sidewalk you obeyed the red lights.

When Japanese get on a a bike however, all rules are off. They bike everywhere, on sidewalks, high speed, and often disregard pedestrians. Quite a fascinating contrast.

Lots of people were saying don't bring too many clothes and I can now say they are definitely right. You can easily do laundry anytime. Just keep in mind that usually an automatic program is used for washing+drying. So make sure to bring clothes which can be put in a dryer as I had quite a few that can't.

Japanese people really like their packaging. Individually wrapped bananas. cookies... the most shocked I was when I bought a pack of tea and now that I opened it, I see 40 teabags each in their own package.

**Edit with other people suggestions:**  
Tip 1: I made so many friends in Japan in June by saying "atsui desu ne." Universally, everyone loves bitching about the weather.  
Atsui: hot  
Samui: cold

Tip 2: I kind of disagree with the suggestion to go to more popular places when it’s bad weather because crowds will be thinner. I went to Asakusa temple on a cold rainy day, and it was still *super* packed, and the fact that everyone had an umbrella made it feel even more miserably crowded.

Tip 3: Don't worry too much about preparing enough, Japan can be definitely enjoyed without a solid plan for each day. Especially when you have internet on your phone you can figure out a lot of things on the go

Tip 4: Shinkansen ticket reservation: it is true that getting familiar to the system is kind of hard. If you try to make a reservation in advanced(more than 1 month I think) you will hard time to make a seat reservation (we still don’t understand on how the system works hehe). However, we were able to change the reservation from Kyoto to Osaka from an early time to late afternoon using the web app. And also we were able to link the tickets to our ic card so we won’t have to go to the machines and get the physical ticket. 

Tip 5: My top tip would be to avoid anything that pops up on instagram as recommended for you. Every such shop or attraction I visited were plagued by tourists, when there were plenty of other comparable options around. Especially be wary of "this is X right now" posts that show amazing sakura blooms etc... I found every single one to be fake.  
Another commenter: One tip from me: don’t follow the Instagram reel suggestions that much. They are rarely hidden gems and mostly generic and overpriced. I would recommend reading comprehensive guides like this one and skip the “Biggest mistake I made” videos with information in the description, or the 5 day itinerary videos that last 2 seconds and list a bunch of generic places you can find by googling the name of the city.  
My personal edit: That being said I've seen some legitimately good advice on Instagram for some flee markets happening, and few restaurants. There's good and bad content as is everywhere on the internet and you need to critically asses everything

Tip 6: Daiso sells some damn good shoe insoles for a fraction of the price compared to NA. So good I bought some more to bring home (couldn't resist the price)

Tip 7: We went in January (18th - 28th) for our first visit, and it was great, and I highly recommend it. We saw some tourists, but basically, we had many popular attractions to ourselves, and the weather was very similar to what we are used to back home in Seattle, so we were very comfortable in the clothes we brought with us. You can't always predict the weather, but you can predict huge crowds in the spring and summer, so work around it.

Tip 8: Carry a small hand towel or wipes as many bathrooms don’t give you anything to dry your hands. Miss being in Japan.

Tip 9: Some apps that have been really useful for me.

The first one is Navitime/Japan Travel. This is great for planning any routes whether they’re long distance or within the city. You can select a start point or use your GPS location and put in where you want to go. It gives you the rail/subway options in detail including where to transfer and which platforms, as well as bus routes if applicable and an approximate fare for a taxi. It also has disaster updates and will highlight any disruption on train lines. Also there are a bunch of other features that I haven’t really touched.  
The second is City Rail Map. This has subway/metro maps for loads of different cities worldwide and you can download one for free to use offline. It uses GPS to show you where on the subway/metro map you are so you can see what the closest station is and where you can go from there. Highly recommend for Tokyo in particular with such a big subway/metro network.  
These apps aside I’ve found the subway systems very easy to use, there are lots of network maps around the stations that are easy to understand where you are and where the lines cross each other. The only one I struggled with at times was Sendai as some of the maps didn’t have the station names written in romaji.

Tip 10: Google maps usage for saving places we want to see: We first tried our own map but it wasn't optimal, lists worked better for us. You can share between each other and easily display / hide from your view. Details here: [https://support.google.com/maps/answer/7280933?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/7280933?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop)

Tip 11: This is an opinion based on personal experience, but I think the quality of English to Japanese conversion on DeepL is better than Google's when it comes to conversation. It seems to me that Google Translate is weak in considering "situations and contexts.

Tip 12: Buying Shinkansen tickets: In Kyoto I did it at the Kyoto station, they have a section of the station dedicated to Shinkansen. They had multiple machines there for buying Shinkansen tickets. In the machine you could find any date and time, select a train and choose seats from the carriage map. I imagine it will be similar in other stations, you can always ask at the information desk. 

Tip 13 about getting 72 hrs subway ticket in Tokyo: IMO it really depends where you are staying because Tokyo has several different transit companies (the metro is covered by the basic pass, and Toei can be added on- but the following are **not part of the pass:**

* JR (including the very popular/convenient Yamanote line)
* Monorail
* The Keiyo Line
* Several private railways (9 of them in total)

The first time I went to Tokyo I was on an private railway (Seibu) and that meant that pretty much anywhere I went I had to pay for two different companies (both Seibu and the metro, or both Seibu and JR etc.) which meant it was 500-800 yen to get anywhere.

Also the metro for short jaunts is only 150-300 yen so you have to take it quite a lot to get the pass money's worth from it.

I think it would only be useful for a small subset of people.

Awesome write up!! Really reflecting my experience here too

### Comment 2

Universally, everyone loves bitching about the weather.

Atsui: hot  

Samui: cold

### Comment 3

Kudasai and gozaimasu.

### Comment 4

We had a really good experience booking Shinkansen tickets with an agent that I’d like to share. My partner had done the research and said that we’d have to go to Tokyo station from Narita to catch our train to Kyoto.

When we went to the attendant, he found a train that departed Shimabashi station (I think, I’ll check and edit if it’s wrong) so we avoided having to transfer through Tokyo station which is enormous and would have taken forever to transfer. The station we ended up transferring in was really small and super easy to navigate.

He also told us to sit in a specific carriage when boarding the train from Narita. The reason was because the back part of the train was going elsewhere at the station before ours. His English was minimal and my Japanese is non-existent but he printed out the itinerary for us and it worked out really well.

We were also lucky there wasn’t a queue because everywhere else

### Comment 5

Thank you for the write up. So helpful!
