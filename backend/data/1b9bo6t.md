# Your favorite Tokyo recommendations for a solo traveler/not a first timer

This is probably my 30th trip to Tokyo so I have been many, many times. Previous trips have all been to visit family, friends, for work, school, or just for fun. I’ve done all the tourist things several times so I’m really looking for your favorite restaurants, hidden gems, specialty shops, lesser known experiences, cooking/crafting/other classes, favorite neighborhood streets to walk down, onsen etc. I’m open to it all! I’m also looking forward to vintage shopping, clothes shopping, and shopping for seasonal merch, so if you have any favorites there feel free to share those too!

There's a cool place called Koffee Mameya Kakeru that does various coffee tasting flights with different beans or brewing methods and little desserts to match each. Really cool and different if you're into coffee. I think you can reserve online too

30x?  To be fair, you probably know as many gems as a local

Izakaya Ippo in Ebisu. Little local place for (as the sign out front says) sake and fish. It’s not truly obscure, having been a regular entry in the Lonely Planet guide since I first chose it from there a decade ago, but hear me out:

It still has the biggest and best sake list I have ever seen (a full page single spaced from around the country, all fantastic), and everything from the sashimi, simmered, grilled, fried, etc are excellent. All up you can get your fill and try several amazing sakes for a shockingly reasonable price. 

I went there twice in one year, and the host recognized me waiting out front, looked my previous reservation up in their book (from six months previous), and greeted me by name. That was spring 2019. November 2023, after reopening, I walk in the door, and he doesn’t remember my name, but he spots my face and remembers I was there before from Canada. Sake and fish pairing recommendations have been 100% impeccable, and it’s always a highlight of trips to Tokyo.

So, I really loved Fuji Q Highland, in Shinjuku Studio Maru Cafe (so cute cat pudding) and in Asakusa you can get Sweet Potato brule - really nice one.
Did you ever went to the Warner Bros Studios? If you like Harry Potter then this is a must see.

But hey, you went many times, so I think you saw these things already xD

Lion Cafe in Shibuya. Classical music on vinyl and a massive stereo system. I could have spent hours in there.
