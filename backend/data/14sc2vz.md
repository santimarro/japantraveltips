# If you’re on the fence about visiting Japan…just go!

It’s been such a memorable trip. 6 days in  Tokyo is nowhere near enough time! Never been to a country with a huge language barrier before and wow! It couldn’t have gone any smoother. The people, the sights, the food!, the public rail/bus system.. all top notch.

 I don’t even know how i’ll be able to go back to crappy “public transportation” (US/Chicago) It’s like this place is run by actual adults who want stuff to work efficiently. I’m mot a huge world traveler so I’m sure there are other places like this. But if you’re ever looking for a new place to visit, 10/10 would recommend Japan. To me, it’s like traveling to the future.

It is one of the best countries of the world to visit as a tourist, period.

### Comment 2

I closed my eyes, said a prayer and booked my tickets for my next trip next year as soon as i got home. As a first time traveller i agree that everything was insanely smooth

### Comment 3

People often describe feeling homesick when they leave Japan even though they’re not from Japan. It really is that special.

My top 3 most favorite countries to visit are Italy, Spain, and Japan (I live in the US but originally from Southeast Asia) And while I arguably enjoy the big cities and the *sights* (architecture and scenery wise) in Spain and Italy more, there's nothing that beats the Japan experience. if I want a smooth, relaxing vacation where there's very little chance of things going wrong and I'm almost guaranteed to love it, I will always pick Japan. Public transport, convenience stores, cleanliness, public manner etc all outshine anywhere else I've ever been. It's one of those places where most visitors will probably either love or at least like it - they really go out of their way to make a visitor's experience pleasant

I live near NYC, that I go there 3-4 times a month and use the public transportation. After the smells, people, how dirty the subway system is in NYC, I know I will be shocked when I go there and see how clean everything is.
