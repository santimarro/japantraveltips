# Hidden Gems of Japan

As a counter balance to the overrated thread, as someone planning a trip in April I prefer a more positive vibe.

What are the underrated activities in Japan ? Highlights of your trip that not everyone does ? Your stand out memory of a trip ?

I'll provide some "instead ofs" instead of hidden gems, because well, I don't know how well hidden these are but...

Instead of Tsukiji Fish Market, if you're passing through smaller seaside cities, see if any of them have any local fish markets (especially with attached restaurants). The price-quality ratio can be expectational.

In Kansai, Akashi market is a good example although Himeji also has at least one. I've had amazing seafood in both markets.

And instead of Arashiyama, there a bamboo forest just south of Kyoto in Muko. Muko is also famous for spicy foods, in fact the town mascot is a chili pepper. You can find insanely spicy things like fried rice, tantanmen, and even gyoza I think. There are guides to the shops online.

Spending a day hopping on and off the only remaining tram line in Tokyo, the Toden Arakawa-sen, in the “Shitamachi” area of north-east Tokyo. 

It’s a really nice way to spend a day exploring Tokyo, and seeing areas where people actually live, rather than just sticking to the central, largely commercial districts of Tokyo. 

Here are a couple of articles on things to do and see while catching the Toden Arakawa-sen:

The tram goes past a couple of old shopping streets, nice older residential areas, and plenty of nice restaurants and cafes. 

Partway along the tram route is Asukayama Park, a large park on top of a hill. As well as some nice views, it has a tiny little funicular railway that takes you up the hill, and there is a children’s playground and a couple of museums up the top, too.

I was looking at cherry blossoms during April 2021 and stumbled across [a place in the middle of nowhere](https://imgur.com/jkRefFI). I'm a huge sakura fan and have visited more than a hundred sakura senbonzakura, namiki, castles, parks, etc., around the country, but it's my absolute favorite. I checked recently and there still isn't an English language review on Google.

I honestly don’t know how underrated it is bc I’ve only just finished my first trip to Japan, but I hadn’t heard of this before we went - Yanaka in Tokyo, particularly the Yanaka-Ginza shopping street. It’s like a time warp to 1950s Tokyo, and it was different from anywhere else we visited. And it was so NOT SWAMPED. We had the most delicious mochi and tea at a coffeehouse and just really loved the vibe.

If you're looking for more underrated cities, I always recommend Izumo (Shimane), especially if you're in the Hiroshima area. Izumo Taisha, Inasa Beach, Hinomisaki Lighthouse, Hinomisaki Jinja, and the soba there are awesome.
