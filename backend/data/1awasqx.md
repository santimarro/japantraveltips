# Tokyo DisneySea? More like Disney QueueLand.

I have never been to a big Disney park before, only Disneyland Paris, so I was so excited to go to a Disney park that's consistently thought of as the best or second best park (according to the Internet).

Please reconsider going to TokyoDisney or DisneySea. The crowd make it awful. 

We went yesterday thinking it wouldn't be too busy in February. It was at 75% capacity apparently. It felt more like 200%. 

Almost immediately after the park opened (after queuing for 45 min) the queue for the 6 or so main attractions (there really aren't that many) had wait times OVER 120 min. If you have the app you can see how long the queues are, we wish we had done this on the days leading up to our visit so we could have understood quite how rammed it was. 

We first got in the queue for one ride (Indianna Jones) when the app said 30 min wait. It was actually 120 min. The ride itself was underwhelming and the animatronics were not as mind-blowing as the Internet would have you believe.

When we got out, there were queues everywhere. Consistently 20 min queues for snack stands. That's not an exaggeration. You can see the wait times for snacks on the app. 

We went to find somewhere to eat - the Teddy Roosevelt Lounge -  and the wait time we were given for a table was 70 min. We got fed up about 30 min into the queue and left only 4 hours after entering the park, after going on 2 rides. And one of those  paid for premier access so the queue was only 20 min but we could only buy 1 before the Premier tickets ran out. 

It sucked and it was something I was really looking forward to. Really put a sour note on our trip and made me never want to go to another Disney park. 

On the bright side, we spent the rest of the day enjoying the lovely weather we had that day. We checked the app every so often to see if the queues ever went down. They went from an average of 2 hours to 1.5 around 6pm. We looked at 8pm and only people with premier access were allowed on the rides, so even if you waited for the park to get quieter, you'd only be able to enjoy the last hour if you paid extra.

Queuing is the national pastime here. The theme park is just there to add ambience.

### Comment 2

Tokyo Disney is famously it’s own beast. 

You have to show up with a game plan, and have the app down to a science, or you’re gonna have a bad time. I recommend the TDR explorer videos on YouTube. 

Heck, I’ve stayed at the miracosta just to get that sweet head start on the all-out run to Soarin’, and I simply bite the bullet for beauty and the beast and paid for fastpasses online. 

Further, unless you’re doing stuff like counter-service, things like teddy Roosevelt need to be booked in the weeks before.

Eh sounds like a typical experience at any big park in Florida as well.

### Comment 4

Normal for TDR, Paris is a lot quicker with some exceptions. 

In Tokyo everybody know excactly how to approach the park. Where to run in the morning, which fastpass to get where waiting makes sense ...

In Paris you can stroll around for 2.5-3 days and manage to do everything at leat once.

I was there on October 31st and basically had no lines over 15 minutes. I rode Journey to the Center of the Earth 3 times.
