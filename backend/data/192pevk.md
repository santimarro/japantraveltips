For the ladies (gentlemen too) ... what did you pack - need - didn't
use?

I'll be there almost three weeks Feb/Mar touring, relaxing, casual and fine dining. What did you find was useful to pack. A dresses), pair of heels, dress pants, jeans, yoga pants, light and heavy jacket, etc...?

Pack a microfiber cloth you can take in your bag/purse. There are rarely paper towels in any bathrooms. Common for most of Asia

A coin purse with dividers was really useful. Bring one or buy it there.

Women wear very loose/conservative clothing in japan.  
To blend in better, I wore a mid length or long skirt every day with layers underneath depending on how cold it was. Along the same lines, yoga pants are not a thing there unless you are wearing them under a skirt.  I ended up never wearing pants, and I wear pants everyday in my normal life. 

  
You're going to be doing an insane amount of walking to get around, your feet will be hurting. I would not take heels unless you have a specific reason you need them. If you need nice shoes I would consider flats instead.

I’m so glad a brought a collapsible duffle bag in my suitcase. It was stuffed to the brim on my way back with all my shopping.

Jeans are fine to wear. Many Japanese women wear jeans although they are considered very casual. Many young women here  wear short skirts only during the colder months. Summer is when everyone pulls out long flowy skirts.

If you’re going to fine dining restaurants you don’t need heels. Flats are perfectly acceptable. 

Dress pants are very common here too so I don’t know why everyone here is telling you to wear long conservative skirts.
