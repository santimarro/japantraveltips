# Is it better to just speak English or try to speak some Japanese?

I know very little Japanese, but enough vocabulary and phrases to probably get around.

Should I start interactions in Japanese or is it better to just establish myself  from the beginning as a foreigner? I'm worried I say something in Japanese then they respond with something I don't understand at all. 

### Comment 1

I think speaking first in Japanese, even poor Japanese, relaxes people who may be self-conscious about their proficiency in English. 

In the sense that you will less likely become frustrated with their English since you understand the difficulty of speaking a language you are not comfortable/fluent in.

It's always nice to start with the language of wherever you are. They'll know you're not Japanese.

### Comment 3

I know this isn't for everyone, but if you're even remotely interested, N5 Level proficiency in Japanese really isn't all that unattainable. I started on vocab for 30 mins a day using Anki last November and I've learned well over 600 words and have been learning grammar through Genki and exposure. I'm confident I could hold small talk conversations. I might sound really dumb sometimes but I think I could get my point across! 

It's worth it if you're even remotely interested

Just write down a few useful sentences in your phone and use them when context allows it. You are going into a country where English is not a commonly spoken language. It's a lack of respect to go and not even try a little. We brought a list of common phrases and we used them as much as possible. Even if you don't pronounce right they'll be thrilled you're at least trying. I suspect we got better service at certain restaurants because we tried speaking japanese. Some locals hit us up for a chat too.

Here now (have visited many times). They all show an appreciation for the effort, it shows how much you value and respect their culture versus jumping right to English. Not proficient by any means. Sometimes I‚Äôll google a few words or phrases too üå∏
