# Mistakes I’ve made in my first day in Tokyo

I’m writing this so you don’t make the same mistakes!!! 

To begin, I planned my trip to Japan within 2 weeks. I felt a need to travel and I’ve been contemplating moving here for years. 

I don’t think this is a good idea, but it’s forced me to learn quick, being very unprepared in terms of plans, destinations and the life, which is a great insight.


1. You will have a ton of coins! You should get a coin pouch. It’s difficult rummaging through my pockets for the right coin. 

2. Don’t overwalk. I walked 20k steps after hardly walking at home. I feel like jello. Seriously the transportation is good. The reason I walked that much was to get lost, which is fun and interesting, but painful and inefficient. 

3. Eat more! Seriously, if you’re moving around a lot eat. You will feel like crap.

4. Fight jet lag by taking sleeping pills. I stayed up for a 14 hour flight and then only got like 5 hours of sleep. It’s not healthy, and I’m going to suffer for it. Take care of yourself. 

Edit… mistake 5-7: not wearing super comfortable clothes that lead to some chafing from all of the walking. If you’re overweight be careful what you wear for long walks.. even if you’re not, try to be comfortable if you’re going out, I was kinda in tight clothing and walking that much was just less enjoyable.

Mistake 6: pet cafe :( 

Mistake 7: not utilitizing IC card to full potential. Probably get some yen but IC is so easy. On my apple wallet, I literally just put my unlocked phone against things and it works. Don’t even need to have the app open. 

Some things I think I got right 


1. Utilitizing the subway towards the end of my day (the end of my day being 2pm cause I’m beat).

2. Going to a animal cafe. It was a great way to feel relaxed after the hustle and bustle. (Edit: maybe not so ethical :( don’t do this). I know back home the ones are rescues and seem to end up adopting out really nice animals. With more research it doesn’t seem like there’s any real positive for the animals. 

3. Sitting in a park. So many great parks. So calm and quiet. 

4. Preparing myself for possible earthquake procedures (just one yesterday hours before I arrived). 

5. Downloading e-sim ahead of time. I used Airalo. 

6. Drinking at half the vending machines. I’d be dead without staying hydrated after walking so much in such a short period of time.


7. Google maps is your best friend. It’s so good here.

8. 7/11 is also your best friend. But don’t forget about family mart and lawsons. All three are great. 

9. Download an IC card if you have apple wallet. FYI some visas don’t work. I got apple credit card and that work, but think you can also use cash at 7/11. 

10. Learning some Japanese beforehand.  It goes a long way and is respectful. 

Overall, Tokyo is the most dense, complex, interesting city I’ve visited. I’m from around New York and nothing could have fully prepared me for how different it is, even though I’ve been looking at videos and tips for months.

Edit: feel free to ask anything. I’ll try to answer from what I know now and what I learn from more time spent here. 

### Comment 1

The IC card should solve a lot of your coin problems. I hardly use cash in Japan anymore… just the occasional vending machine or something. IC cards are accepted almost anywhere (not just limited to subway/trains). You can use it in most stores, restaurants, convenience stores, etc.

And just to add a bit of info, the apple credit card works because it’s a Mastercard.

### Comment 2

I really wanted to download my pasmo on my iPhone but seeing that Visa cards may not work has me thinking I should just continue to use the pasmo I got on my last trip.

I made the same mistake day 1 too. I walked about 30k steps and even though I worked out specifically to walk I didn’t do anything like that. My legs were fine the day after but one of my feet hurt for like 5 days. Had to just walk through the pain.

One thing I’d add is to learn to slow down. I was so excited and everyday I was moving so much and seeing so much. My last day in Tokyo I just sat by the beach in odaiba for like 2 hours just taking it in. It was great.

I hope you enjoy the rest of your trip. I’ll be out there in April so this was some good info/reminders

### Comment 3

Agree with most apart from walking. If you can handle it and have the time, walk everywhere - I often found cool cafes, stores or temples just walking from point A to B.

### Comment 4

In regard to point #6 on staying hydrated, are there public restrooms readily accessible?

### Comment 5

Some feedback for OP:

1. Coins.  Get a SUICA or PASMO card.  Use that for sundry purchases.  Otherwise yes, you will collect coins.  Also: merchants love exact change.
2. Start doing walking exercises working up distance prior to your trip.  It helps a lot.  I was told a typical Japanese does about 10K steps/day.   That should be your target.
3. Eat as often as you can.  The food is excellent there and one of the highlights of the trip.  If it is hot there during the summer, you'll be constantly tanking up on fluids, but do not neglect food.  One hint: try the Pocari Sweat, it's their version of Gatorade, has a non-offensive mild citrus taste, and is loaded with electrolytes.  You can find it in every vending machine.  Good for warding off muscle cramps while you are asleep.
4. We solve this by taking the LAX or SFO flight that arrives in Haneda around 5AM or so.  By the time you clear customs/immigration, the train lines are starting up.  You can schlep to the hotel and drop off your bags and they will hold them for you until you can check in.  In the meantime, use the time to look around and get your bearings.  You won't fall asleep when walking.  The goal is to sleep as much as possible on the flight, then stay awake as long as possible when you arrive. This is easy with these flights because they leave around 1-2AM in the US.  Stay up for those, and you'll definitely get some shut eye-on the plane. For me, if I can manage until 6PM (or later) staying awake after arrival, I'll be a bit of an early riser the next day (4AM-6AM), but I'll be able to stay up late on day 2.  After that, I'm on local time.

Don't worry about sleeping in a bit - most places (shops, etc) don't open until later in the morning.  I won't bother going out until 10AM unless I have to spend a bunch of time on the train to get there.   This requires a bit of planning, but chances are you will be waking up early, so utilize the time researching the day and making an itinerary.

f you want to get out earlier, do so.  Take a stroll at 8AM and walk around watching the city wake up.  Tons of Japanese are out at that time getting their exercise in.
