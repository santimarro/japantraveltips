# 13 Things to do In Nagoya Plus 2 Extras- Why It Is Worth Visiting

Let's be honest, it's not at the top of anyone's to-do list for their trip to Japan.  


It has been dubbed the most boring city in Japan on numerous occasions.  
It is not hard to see why Tokyo, Kyoto, Nara, Hiroshima, etc., receive so much praise.  
However, much of this is due to people's mental images of what Japan looks like rather than reality.  
But after living here for 24 years and having shown a number of folks around, it does have a lot to offer.  
All without the masses of tourists.  
It is central, so it makes a good base for travelling. Tokyo is a few hours away, and Osaka and Kyoto are under an hour away.  
***Things to do In Nagoya***

  
**Atsuta Shrine**  
Atsuta Shrine, or Atsuta Jingu, is a fascinating and historically significant attraction in Nagoya. It is one of Japan's oldest shrines, with a rich history of over 1,900 years.  
**Osu Temple and shopping**  
Osu Kannon Temple is a dynamic and bustling Nagoya destination with a distinct blend of history, culture, and shopping. It offers everything from traditional Japanese crafts and secondhand colothes to modern gifts.

  
**Shirotori Garden**  
This is a peaceful garden in the city. The main pond models Ise Bay. The steep hill in the southwest part represents volcanic Mt. Ontake, and the stream that flows from the hill is the Kiso River.  
**Sakae**  
This is the downtown area with shops, and the new central park makes a relaxing place to enjoy a coffee.  
**Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology**  
You can see how automobiles have evolved throughout time.  
**Toganji Temple**  
The temple dates back to the 1600s and is a beautiful example of traditional Japanese architecture and design.  
**SCMAGLEV and Railway Park**  
You can learn about the history of trains in Japan and see a variety of old and new trains on display.  
**Nagoya Food**  
It is THE best in Japan, but not the most famous. Redi miso, tebasaki (chicken wings), hitsumabushi ( grilled eel on rice), Miso Katsu...  
**Nagoya Public Aquarium**  
It is great for kids and has a good half a day's worth of stuff to do and see.  
**Nagoya City Science Museum**  
The museum has many hands-on displays that showcase the newest science and technology, including robots and virtual reality experiences.  
The planetarium is one of the best parts of the museum.  
**The Electricity Museum**  
It sounds boring but is fun, and my kids loved it.  
**Nittaiji Temple**  
Nagoyaâ€™s 1904 Buddhist temple honors Thailand-Japan connections.  
**Ghibli Park**  
Just outside the city. The name says it all.  
**Nagashima Spa Land and Nabana no sato**  
Both are actually in Mie but less than a 30-minute drive away. There is a fun amusement park with great roller coasters and a flower park with amazing night displays.  
Overall, there are many more things to do than I mentioned above.  
It's also not far from many other places ( both urban and rural), which makes it a good base.

Legoland Japan is also a great way to spend a day. The replicas of famous places in Japan are spectacular but the must see is the life-sized cherry blossom tree made of bricks.Â
