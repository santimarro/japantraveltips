# Reminder: do not interact with the touts/promoters at shinjuku (or any other entertainment districts) at night

Tonight, I was casually walking down the street with the Godzilla statue and witnessed one of those Nigerian touts in action with a new scam tactic.

Those Nigerians only target tourists, doesn't matter if you are Caucasian, Black African, or South American, if you don't look like a local Japanese, they will come approach you. 

This evening, they harassed a group with a girl and two white guys. They shoved a phone in the girl's face but she pushed it away, it dropped to the ground and the screen went defective (was probably defective to begin with). The Nigerian guys tried to extort money for the broken phone but the group resisted and walked away to a quiet alley (bad mistake). Down the alley, the Nigerians grabbed the girl by the arm and they started a verbal fight. It got physical between the men and my partner didn't want to stick around so we left and didn't know how things ended.

Edit: don't understand the down votes, it's an anecdotal warning to travellers on a common recurring issue in Tokyo.

Someone posted in /r/japantravel that another tactic used is to physically grab a tourist. In their case they grabbed his wife's arm and started shouting in their faces, since the guy didn't understand japanese they untangled and walked away. this was only two or three days back.


It seems the scam was to aggro them into getting physical and then demanding compensation... it's getting weird over there.

I’ve also seen them do it to locals as well. It’s best to just ignore them and go on your way as fast as you can.

Jeez. It must be getting worse. I was there on the same street in March (so lucky to get to go) and was well aware as my friends had all told me that the scammers are around.

A guy literally ran across the street to get in my face and just tried to disarm and made it clear I knew the game and wasn't going to fall for it , and instead of moving on to the next target they started yelling at me and following me. It was really shit, the only thing that soured the tokyo experience .

People told me to avoid them but didn't make it seem like they'd scream at you, follow you and try and get violent. Truly shit.

Ngl shinjuku is terrible where that Godzilla statue area is.

 I tell people to just skip it at night now.

I had my first encounter with them last night. I already knew to ignore them from reading the posts here so as soon as I see one making eye contact with me I was like fuuck. I turned to a different alley and he kept trying to talk to me and eventually chased after me. When he caught up with me I told him no English and then he starts talking in Spanish and then in Portuguese (I’m Hispanic) and I was like damn this guy is good. I stayed quiet and kept ignoring him. Next thing I know the alley cuts off into 2 directions and there’s a group of 4 Nigerians at the center and that’s when I really started getting scared. I was like fuck they’re gonna try to jump me but they just looked at me as I kept walking and eventually the other guy left me alone. It was still pretty early and there were people walking around but fuck that they’ve discouraged me from walking around that area. My hotel is in Kabukicho so I gotta find an alternative route to avoid them lol. They seem to be all over Kabukicho too, you avoid one and another takes it’s place, if you’re out there avoid walking alone late at night.

Also I was in the koreatown area north of Kabukicho this morning and I see them walking around naturally among the locals not pestering anyone. I just found it funny like they haven’t started their shift yet in annoying people.
