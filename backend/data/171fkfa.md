# Get some cash out before getting a welcome suica card.

When I arrived to grab a welcome suica card there was a very long line (I got my wifi first so I was at the end) from the 12 people (not including me) in the line before me, all but 1 person had to either use cash or walk away because their credit card or travel card declined (including me)

Luckily I got 20000 yen before arriving at the country. There was also an ATM which worked just fine for cash out which helped out a lot of people.

Edit. At the airport. My credit card, debit card and travel card all have pin and chip.

Can you use the iPhone with the new OS to just tap and go?

If there is a long line for welcome suica, my advice is just leave. Get a Pasmo passport instead... either at the airport or at the [various other stations around Tokyo.](https://www.pasmo.co.jp/visitors/en/buy/) 

You have plenty of other opportunities to spend time lining up in Japan. ðŸ˜‰

Were you using a ticket machine? If so, I'm going to guess you're from the US or otherwise from a nation that doesn't use chip + pin credit cards. Train ticket machines in Japan require chip + pin cards, so you won't be able to use a credit card in any of the limited express or shinkansen ticket machines if you don't have one.

If your card didn't work at the counter/travel center, then I would look into your card and make sure it isn't locked or something, since foreign cards should definitely work there.

That's great, so glad you had it already. Forbes recommends that people use their bank to get a some foreign currency before they go. The big banks deal in volume and the charge to do so is nominal, so check with yours. You can also open a Wise account. I paid $2, and got 147Â¥ per USD. Today it's up to 149Â¥. Also, while there might be a small charge to use the ATM, on the back end, your bank will charge 1-3% per foreign ATM transaction. So put as much as you are allowed onto the Welcome Suica or Pasmo Passport with cash and then spend down with that.

I have Â¥1000 left over from my last trip, so I can still get a Welcome Suica even if I haven't been able to hit an ATM yet.
