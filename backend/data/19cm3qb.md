# Luggage and reserved luggage seats on Shinkansen - other people using our space

What is the etiquette when we have reserved seats on Shinkansen and made sure to book / reserve oversize luggage seats for our oversize luggage and other people are using the space? It has happened with us on every train this trip - on some trains the conductors come and find the people who have used the luggage space and tell them to move it but more often than not no one does anything and people just shove their luggage in so when we board there’s no space. We have been just dealing with it and squashing our luggage in front of our feet but as the trip goes on I’m getting angrier and angrier about it. We have booked our seats well in advance for this very reason so that we can travel on the Shinkansen with our luggage and I’m frustrated that we are not able to. Can I just move other people’s luggage? Do I speak to someone? How will they know whose luggage isn’t supposed to be there? What the actual point is reserving those seats if we can’t use it anyway? I cannot lift my luggage up and I shouldn’t have to when I have reserved seats to be able to put my luggage.

The conductor should be able to move it somewhere else when you tell them. Were they not doing that? I would complain directly to JR Central if they don't.

Speak to one of the train conductors

My husband and I witnessed this with passengers next to us when we travelled to Kyoto. Some random guy put his luggage there before this couple had the chance to put there’s in, they managed to fit it but they were constantly having to rearrange it and in the end one of them pulled one luggage next to their seat cause it kept rolling out. 

If that had happened to us (we made sure we were the first on the train to ensure this didn’t happen to us) we would have pulled his out to put ours in lol. Like you said - you went out of your way to book those specific seats! 

But honestly I don’t think people realise that it’s a reserved area, it wouldn’t be too much of an issue to have whoever put their luggage there to move it. And if it is, call over the conductor.

Speak to the conductor, show them your reservation email and leave it up to them. 

It can be an honest mistake of people not knowing the space was reserved or that it can be reserved in the first place. 

People aren't able to correct their mistakes if they're not made aware of it.

Speak to the conductor.

Which spots are people putting their luggages? Do you mean the racks at the end of the carriages or the space behind the special rear seats for oversized luggage? 

Something we’ve been doing even with reserved seats is to be the first people in line for our carriage.
