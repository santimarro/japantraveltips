# PSA: Don’t wear clothes in an onsen

There are tourists who wear clothes in an onsen for whatever reason. However, it is very disrespectful to not follow the onsen etiquette. If you can’t take your clothes off, please don’t go to an onsen.

Thanks for the PSA.   


Edit: edit for clarity ROFL

Also, genuine question, I promise I am not trolling. I am FAT. Would I be subject to judgment if I go to the onsen? Like a "ew jumbotron incoming". I booked to go to a ryokan, but now that the date is drawing near I am getting kinda worried. I hope most people can  be like "none of my business, not even looking".

### Comment 3

As a very short sighted person, I'm considering visiting the onsen without my glasses too. IRL censored experience.

### Comment 4

There are also places that are co ed where you wear swimsuits. I'm guessing it's not truly an onsen, but for foreigners it may be good enough.

### Comment 5

It’s an onsen people. Not a damn swimming pool. Get with the program.
