# Normal for locals to laugh and stare at you at a restaurant? (Shibuya)

We ate at a restaurant and a couple of 20 something year olds were laughing and pointing at my family struggling to order at a restaurant. 

It got so bad that we really wanted to say, “wtf are you staring at?!” But wanted to respect the other patrons.

Has anyone else experienced this? If I was in my home country and I saw a foreigner struggling to order, I would not point and laugh. Maybe it’s just me.

I feel your pain lol. Had a bunch of high schoolers make fun of me and my partner bc we kept pulling on a sliding door into a restaurant. To add insult to injury when they ended up going to the same restaurant, and mimicked the pulling motion. Teenage kids are the same everywhere, including Japan haha.

Had the same thing happen to me at Tokyo Disney. Despite what you hear about Japan, not all the locals are nice. Cruelty is just as much a thing there as it is anywhere else. People talk up Japan and put it on a pedestal in terms of kindness… but be there long enough and you’ll realize it’s just like anywhere else. Plenty of kind people, but also plenty of disrespectful people. Anyway, don’t let it ruin your experience! Accept that people are the same there as anywhere else and Enjoy your time in Japan!

Yeah, rude people are everywhere. I had lunch in Minowa, an area of Tokyo that doesn’t see too many tourists. The restaurant I visited was empty of customers except for a senior Japanese woman. When I sat down at the counter, a few seats away from her, she started shouting in Japanese. The word “Gaijin” was used. 

The owner of the restaurant knew some English, and translated for me that the customer wanted me to sit further away, so I moved to the end of the counter. Apparently she is a regular and does this all the time. In the two weeks I was in Japan, this was the only real negative encounter I had.

Yes, I've seen this all over the world everywhere. Young people laughing at people 




Not a big deal unless you make it one

Yeah, what you experienced is not really uncommon. I lived in Japan for 4 years. The Japanese are not what I would define as overly 'kind'. They will stay mostly to themselves and cover disdain for you lightly with manners. I've helped an older Japanese woman off the street who fell and people just walked around her. It is more acceptable to mind your own business and keep walking. I did encounter people in my local community who, after a few months, understood I was living there and started to exchange 'hello's and 'good mornings'. I've also been on a crowded train where the two spots on either side of me remained empty the whole way because everyone was scared of the white girl. Another time, a man came and told my friend that she only needed to eat half her food because she was too big. I love Japan but they have assholes too.
