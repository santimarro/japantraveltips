# Taxis are underrated in Tokyo

I just got back from a week in Tokyo. Taxis are severely underrated (especially if you have a group of 3-4). They are often much more efficient than taking the subway, if you have 4 people like we did taking a cab is basically often a few bucks more per person than the subway.

It's okay for short trips but you quickly run into a > 10,000¥ fare. If your trip is during rush hours the subway is a no brainer.

### Comment 2

Time is money for tourists. Many people on this subreddit attempt to present themselves as experts and recommend what they believe is the best option, so they favor metro and other railways.
However, taking a taxi typically saves you a significant amount of time, and you're less likely to get lost since it delivers you directly to your destination.
Many of them simply ignore the fact that some people prioritize comfort and efficiency over saving money.

Could be helpful in the right circumstances in Tokyo

OTOH - Kyoto tourists should seriously consider using, due the skeleton subway system and the typ  brief stops at  scattered sites 

BTW, did you utilize any taxi apps or just street hailed?

Tip: on Google maps, you will see a little speaker icon near the address, if you click it, it brings up a nice taxi card with the description of the location and the address (in japanese), that was very helpful. It will also speak it in Japanese.

I’ve used them before - they are an excellent option.
That said, I usually use trains etc partly because I just like it? 
And I tend to travel cheap, but they are good to use when needed.
