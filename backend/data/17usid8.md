# What are some experiences to be had in Japan that was unforgettable for you?

As someone that grew up watching Anime, Japan has a special place in my heart, more than just another vacation spot, which I'm sure many of you feel the same way here. I'm visiting Japan in February for 16 days and will spend time in Tokyo and potentially Kyoto areas. I'd like to visit the typical tourist areas, but also want to seek out experiences unlike just any other tourist attractions. 

I feel like staying in the city won't give me the kind of exposure I am looking for of Japan. I am looking for an experience where I can reflect in the future and think, that was amazing/unforgettable. What are some experiences you have had in Japan that you found to be more memorable and special compared to staying in the large cities and sticking to the typical tourist itineraries?

It could be something as simple as biking around in a rural town, renting cars for road-trips, onsen focused experiences etc.

Honestly, to me itâ€™s just wandering the alleyways of whatever city youâ€™re in. The cities of Japan are so pedestrian friendly, the walking paths across neighborhoods are so quaint and often filled with beautiful gardens. Thereâ€™s just something so cozy about walking down a quiet neighborhood alleyway, filled with residential homes, konbini stores, vending machines and izayakas. It really makes you feel a bit like an anime character walking home from school/work.

(Hida) Takayama was my first and most memorable exposure to the more rural side of Japan. Your Name is loosely based in that town. If thereâ€™s still snow if you visit it makes for an incredible winter experience. I stayed at a guest house. They have a little farmerâ€™s market on certain days. Itâ€™s a sleepy town which contrasts nicely with the urban landscapes of major cities. 10/10. I went there directly after Tokyo my first trip to Japan. This town single-handedly is responsible for me planning a trip to a new rural town every visit but I think that next trip Iâ€™m going back to Takayama. As an added bonus, the train ride there is something I canâ€™t begin to describe: peaceful, quiet, and completely surrounded by nature/mountains

Hakone is the site of Tokyo-3 in Neon Genesis Evangelion. Thereâ€™s an Eva themed Lawsons, Togendai Station is done up like NERV HQ, and you can visit Hakone Shrine and Lake Ashi featured in the show. 

Yokohama has Gundam Factory Yokohama and you can visit the RX-78-2 Gundam statue.

ETA: changed a number

For me it was going on a tour to mount Fuji and hakone, we had gone our entire trip without doing tours but were having some trouble figuring out how to get there

 on our own so we booked a tour last minute the day before, because we were on a very strict budget we opted out of the lunch option and instead picked up some sandwiches and drinks at a 7-11. 

When we got on the bus and started driving to Fuji the tour guide was asking who had picked the lunch option, everyone but my brother and I had gotten it, she was really concerned that we'd go hungry lol, stopped at a rest stop, grabbed a few souvenirs and coffee for my brother then continued on to the hotel where we'd have lunch, they went off to the restaurant while we found a place to sit and eat our sandwiches, because we had finished so fast we were able to walk around outside, it was right next to an amusement park and mountains all around us, just a gorgeous day while we explored, did a bit of shopping too, I'll never forget that time while the rest of the people were trying to eat a bunch of food really fast because of the limited time we were outside actually enjoying the area.

We eventually continued on up onto Fuji, as it wasn't climbing season we only went up halfway to an area with shops, restrooms and food, was slightly disappointed because the top of Fuji was covered in clouds but as we went back down the clouds cleared up for a bit and the bus driver pulled over so we could grabbed a few pics and see it, he was even taking pics because it was a rare ish sight.

Afterwards they took us to hakone where we took a boat trip across a lake, sadly the weather at that point turned against us so we weren't able to go in a cable car to the top of another mountain where there was a temple, there was a small aquarium we were able to explore as a different option.

They then took us to the train station where as part of the tour package we got bullet train tickets back into Tokyo, sadly at that point I had a horrible headache from the altitude changes and wasn't fully able to enjoy the train but all in all it was a fantastic day with amazing people and my most fond memory.

            Ps sorry for the book ðŸ˜‚

The first time my partner and I went to Japan, we were lucky enough to be taken around Japanese nightlife by a friend of his who lives there. First, we stopped by an okonomiyaki bar. Then, a sake bar where we drank with Japanese businessmen and I tried many varieties of sake, both hot and cold. Finally, a stop at a convenience store for a late night corndog, followed by drunken karaoke where we sang the night away.

As a huge fan of the movie Lost in Translation, there was something about that night that was so surreal, my partner and I holding hands and running through the streets of Tokyo, while his Japanese friend ran forward holding his umbrella as a guide. It was raining lightly, and the raindrops kept catching the light of street lamps, and the streets were packed because the next day was a national holiday. It was a magical night but I'd never been so hungover the next day ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
