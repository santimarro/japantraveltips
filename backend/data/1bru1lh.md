# what in Japan is really hyped but not really worth it in your opinion?

places, sights, food, whatever comes in your mind.

As a native Japanese, I am sure that foreigners sometimes overestimate the people’s kindness, integrity, or honesty :P

I think the Ghibli Museum is very sweet even if you're not a fan of the studio, but I feel like it's absolutely not worth some people having to fight for their lives trying to navigate the reservation portal and/or potential pay *10x* the asking price on 3rd party vendors lol.

Any individual restaurant that has been hyped by influencers. 

There are tens of thousands of excellent restaurants in Japan, and you definitely don't need to go to the specific one that this week's shouty youtuber is hyping.

I honestly didn’t realise I was at Shibuya Crossing until I had a slight feeling of Deja vu. It’s just a crossing outside a train station - honestly not sure why it’s so romanticised. I love Shibuya in general, though. I couldn’t have had a better home base for my first trip.

Super Potato in Akihabara gets a surprising amount of reverence considering everything is an absolute rip off. It’s *okay* if you treat it like a museum, but I wouldn’t spend a single yen there.

Most places hyped on instragram/tiktok/etc where you see a 2hr line up of mainly foreigners. Ichiran is especially guilty of this.
