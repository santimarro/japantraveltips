# Please try some other restaurants

As a long, long-term resident of Tokyo I see so many people posting on here all planning to go to the same restaurants it seems. Of course I understand people get information from bloggers and Youtubers etc. but I thought I might give a list of some other restaurants that local people go to. 

I’m not saying these are necessarily better than some place that a YouTuber recommended, but these are places where you are definitely less likely to run into other tourists and only eat with locals. Every time I walk by Ichiran in Shinjuku I have to chuckle to myself seeing all of the tourists waiting in line. 

The following are all on the west side of Tokyo, basically in the Shinjuku area since that’s my part of town. Please try some of them. You won’t be disappointed. In fact just walking into any random restaurant is a great idea since food is so wonderful in Tokyo, and super cheap now if you are coming from abroad. I have deliberately focused on Japanese food, cutting out Chinese, pizza etc.

### Comment 1

I've just been asking locals at bars and our hotels where to eat. It's been working great so far. Had nothing in particular in mind coming here. This works out for me everywhere I travel.

### Comment 2

Any recommended okonomiyaki spots in Tokyo area in general?

### Comment 3

Lmao, I just left ichiran Ramen. I had no idea it was a tourist hotspot because there was only one couple before me. I liked it! And I had no idea that it catered to solo diners, so it was a wonderful surprise.

I deleted Instagram, Facebook, Twitter years ago and I never signed up for Snap Chat or Tik Tok. My usual research is going through Reddit and googling blogs/'best of' lists. 

I'll keep your list in mind. Thank you!

### Comment 4

I basically wander about and plug in to see some online reviews/pictures then go. While it's fun to sometimes check out a popular hot spot, I really don't want to spend my whole trip waiting on instagram food, lol.

### Comment 5

Ichiran is like In-N-Out for Japan. Pretty good but overrated as heck
