# Coping with POST Japan Travel Tips 

Tip: eat EVERYTHING while you are in Japan, everything you want just eat it ! And go back for more if you have room! AND buy snacks to bring home as you go throughout your travels

Now that I‚Äôm back I‚Äôm wishing I had more fresh mochi, another mini octopus with quail egg inside the head and I wish I would have tried okonomiyaki. I bought some snacks there but the mochi we got turned out to be pretty average.

2 questions 
1 if anyone has tried them, there any Japanese snack/special item subscription boxes that are worth the price and good quality? 
2 are there any restaurant recommendations in Edmonton, Calgary or Vancouver Canada with top notch/authentic Japanese food, hopefully one of the above rarer foods? I do plan on hitting T&T supermarket as well to get snacks! 

Sorry if this is not allowed, thanks in advance!

Yup, one tip that I tell all my friends is that since breakfast isn't really a thing in Japan, eat a very light breakfast on most days, unless you're actually trying local cuisine.  Like either a coffee with a bun or pastry.  This way whenever you pass the street food you always have some appetite and will keep trying new things.

Yes! This 100x. I‚Äôm leaving Japan next week and I‚Äôm not looking forward to going back to the States. The quality of food will be a downgrade with the prices up. I‚Äôve gotten used to not tipping with quality service. And the efficiency of all restaurants‚Ä¶like ALL restaurants from the hole in the wall type to more expensive restaurants. Most importantly the convenience stores. I‚Äôm trying to eat as many pastries as I can while I‚Äôm here. The freshness of pastries are untouchable. The occasional acne is totally worth it hahaha

100% buy as many of your favourite snacks while in Japan to bring back home. I stuff my bags as full as I can and I'm a carry-on only kind of person. My #1 fave is Jagabee potato sticks. They only come with like 10 sticks in each packet so I need as many packets as I can stuff in.




In Calgary there are a few places to get snacks besides T&T, try True World Foods. They are a small grocery store with a bunch of snacks, drinks, onigiri, sashimi, various frozen goods, sauces, and other general Japanese pantry items.




Tokyo Street Market has a little small market of snacks as well. It's a restaurant with some really affordable prices.




One of my favourite Japanese restaurants is called Japa Redheads Cafe in downtown. Their buffet brunch is amazing with curry and pork katsu.

Ok so having been to Japan, tried Tokyo Treat and living in Vancouver and experiencing good sushi hopefully my words will help. 

1. Tokyo treat is good but very expensive for what you get. I actually can‚Äôt recommend it, especially shipping to Canada. It cost close to 200 bucks for 3 boxes. Each box has an actual value of about 15 bucks max. I would suggest just ordering Japanese snacks from Amazon sadly. I know paying bezos anymore sucks but it‚Äôs sooo much cheaper, you get way more, delivery is much better and you can get a lot of the same things. 

2. There‚Äôs a lot of good authentic spots for sushi here in Vancouver. From small family run to
Michelin star. We have 2 sushi omakase restaurants that are Michelin star, many that only do omakase (and well - like sushi bar maumi) that aren‚Äôt recognized my Michelin but are damn good. Plus we have tones of small places like Dosanko which serve very traditional Japanese dishes prepared the same way with all Japanese staff. 

I suggest googling such things on maps and just explore but I am happy to provide suggestions. It just takes me a while to go through my list. 

I hope this helps!! üôè
