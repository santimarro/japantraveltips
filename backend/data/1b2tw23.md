# Leaving tomorrow for Japan

Any last minute tips or must haves before arrival? 

We are getting cash beforehand, added Suica to our Apple wallets, and do plan to take a cab from the airport since itâ€™s a very early arrival. 

Anything else?

Don't forget to do your Visit Japan Web submission

We leave tomorrow too. Suica, pocket WiFi/ esim, a small bit of cash to get you started and a coin pouch, complete customs and have your QR code ready to showâ€¦Download Japanese to google translate - itâ€™s very handy! I also found out you can download an area map on google maps for offline use so thatâ€™s worth doing! 
Enjoy ðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜Œ

Make sure the stove is off.

Will drive you crazy the whole time.

Consider taking an empty luggage with you :)

### Comment 5

Youâ€™ve likely already packed.  But pack less.  Every hotel I stayed in had SUPER convenient washer/dryer setup.    Wish I had taken 40% less clothing.
