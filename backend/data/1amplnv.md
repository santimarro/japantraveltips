# My experience of buying Ghibli Museum tickets 2024 (Lawson English site)

Since the Ghibli Museum tickets go on sale very soon (10am JST on the 10th) for the March dates, I thought I'd share my experience of buying tickets last month on the Lawson (English) ticket site. *Link: [https://l-tike.com/st1/ghibli-en](https://l-tike.com/st1/ghibli-en)*

&#x200B;
1. &nbsp;I accessed the Lawson site around 9:30am JST to join the waiting room before the actual queueing started. The waiting room page loads around 30 mins before tickets go on sale. At this point I wasn't actually assigned a queue number, but I'd read it's **important to join before 10am**. If you join after this time you'll apparently be placed at the back of the queue, whereas if you've been waiting prior to 10am you should be randomly assigned a place in the queue.  
&#x200B;
2. &nbsp;If you've planned to join the waiting room, make sure the page actually loads! My husband managed to join the waiting room before I did, whereas the page wouldn't load for me despite refreshing the Lawson ticket site multiple times. I eventually joined the waiting room after going back onto the Ghibli museum site and re-accessing the Lawson site from there.  
&#x200B;
3. &nbsp;After joining the waiting room, I found I didn't need to refresh the page at 10am. I was automatically assigned a number just after 10am and didn't need to refresh after that point either.  **But** experiences may vary from browser to browser so I can't say for sure whether refreshing/not refreshing is the way to go.  
&#x200B;
4. &nbsp;**Join on multiple devices** for the best chance of securing a good queue spot! My husband and I joined on 5 devices. I got a place in the 900s on an old laptop whereas my husband's fancier devices were in the 9000s! Since I'd joined the waiting room after him, I think the queue assignment really is random regardless of when you join the waiting room *prior to 10am*.  
&#x200B;
5. &nbsp;The dates/times at the beginning of the month seem to sell out first. I've read the museum has limited capacity for screenings of their short film so a morning/noon arrival slot is recommended if you plan to watch it.  
&#x200B;
6. &nbsp;Have the following details ready for the booking page:
&#x200B;
    * **leader's name**
    * **nationality**
    * **arrival airport**
    * **departure airport**
    * You'll also need to create a short 4-digit login password for ticket access.  


Edit: based on previous posts, make sure third-party cookies browsers are **not** blocked on your browser. Blocking them has apparently led to access issues when it comes to the booking page.


Good luck!

**Just an FYI - ticket resale in Japan is illegal and if ID is checked, you might not be admitted to the park. You will also not get a refund from the reseller.**

### Comment 2

Tried last month, I was in the 5000 range. When I got thru, picked a date/time, entered all my info including payment. Only for the site to then "crap" out. I kept trying for over 45 minutes but the site kept having issues. After 45 minutes, all tickets were gone. Now in line for March. Was in the 9000, 12 minutes away from getting in. Wish me luck.

And as expected, I am SOL. All sold out. Maybe on my next trip.

### Comment 3

I'm guessing these sell out super quickly then? How far in advance do you need to buy and how fast do they sell out?

And for those that have gone, would you say it was worth it (considering the museum is not near anything major).

### Comment 4

Just to clarify - refresh to make sure you're in the waiting room? And then once 10am JST happens and you get a number, don't do anything at all? No further refreshing needed once you have your number in line?

Once your place in line came up and you were able to pick a date/time, any further troubles?

This is my family's first "bucket list trip" together and my kids have loved the Ghibli movies they've seen, with Totoro at #1. We have 5 full days in Tokyo, and a trip to this museum is a priority.

THANKS SO MUCH!

### Comment 5

~~Almost~~ everything full. I couldn't get a ticket sadly. I had hope but after a couple of steps it still said that I couldn't get in.
