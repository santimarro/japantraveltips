# Tourists banned from areas in Kyoto

I've seen a lot about this on instagram, so some may already know about this, but haven't seen it here yet so if you're planning on visiting the more traditional parts of Kyoto to see the cherry blossoms or any trips in the future, you should be aware that some places are completely closed off to tourists. From what I understand this is mostly in the Gokagai area, where the geisha districts are, so Gion Kobu, Gion Higashi, Kamishichiken, Pontocho, and Miyagawacho but from the maps it definitely appears to mostly be in the Gion area, the small private streets where people live, those quieter places off of the main drag, are now no longer allowing tourists to walk through them regardless of where you're from. The reason behind this ban is the harassment that has been prevalent towards the Geiko and Maiko that are practicing and living there, including physical assault, and people not respecting the locals privacy including ignorantly walking into their entrance ways. There are signs to let you know if a place is restricted from tourists, so if you're planning on visiting, please be aware and keep an eye out for them.

This is overblown a million-fold. Mostly aggressive jerks demanding selfies. Geishas are highly respected and cherished; sad that idiots have disrespected them.

I'm at a hotel in the gion district now. Haven't seen any issues personally being around geishas, or being restricted from areas yet. Just be polite and respectful. I know it'll be more restricted in April, but I feel like it's being overblown on social media, even though I don't mind it if it gets people to stop being shitty. 

You wouldn't believe how many foreigners I've had to tell to be quiet on mass transit because they are essentially yelling in a completely quiet spot.

Tourists did this to themselves. I am not even mad. Geisha/maikos just want to do their job.


As someone from a tourist heavy town, i understand Kyoto residents frustration.

Went to Gion end of February and some private side streets already had prohibition to take pictures and security guards. It was only a few streets, not a big deal.
