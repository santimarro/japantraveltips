Warning: Do not go to Dotonbori, Osaka, tonight

The famous baseball team, the Hanshin Tigers, will win  their first Central League title in 18 years if they win tonightâ€™s game. About 20 years ago, when they previously won, there were riots and hooligans around the Dotonbori area, and some people jumped into the Dotonbori River and threw many things into it as well. There will be approximately 1,300 police officers patrolling tonight.

Be cautious and stay safe.

Update:
They obtained the title tonight, around 20:50. Today is the most crowded and dangerous day. Tomorrow will be safe and okay.

Hope KFC is hiding the Colonel

### Comment 2

It's not the Japan Series, this is just them clinching 1st place in the Central League (which was already a foregone conclusion considering they are *13 games* *ahead* of Hiroshima).

I'm sure fans will still go nuts, but they'd probably go much more nuts if they actually did win the national championship (which isn't for another 1.5 months).
