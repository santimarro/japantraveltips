An IC card is a rechargeable transit fare card (also known as a contactless smart card) that can be used to pay for public transit (trains, most buses) across Japan. These cards are similar to other transit cards used worldwide, such as the Oyster Card in London, the TAP Card in Los Angeles, the Octopus Card in Hong Kong, or the OV-Chipkaart in the Netherlands. IC cards can be purchased at automatic ticket machines and ticket counters at nearly every station across the country. IC cards do not cover travel on the Shinkansen, highway buses, or airport buses.

The IC card automatically calculates the fare traveled and deducts that fare from the card's stored balance. Cards can be "topped up" at any ticket machine bearing the universal [IC card logo](https://www.jreast.co.jp/multi/welcomesuica/img/img_ic_logo.png). Utilizing an IC card also offers a slight discount (~￥5) on train fare versus purchasing an individual ticket.

IC Cards can also be used at vending machines, convenience stores, drug stores, some department stores, and some restaurants. Generally, wherever the universal [IC card logo](https://www.jreast.co.jp/multi/welcomesuica/img/img_ic_logo.png) is displayed, IC cards are accepted for payment. After 2020, IC card-as-payment became much more common, and you can find many places that will take it for common purchases.

When arriving in Japan, the IC card you receive depends on where you first obtain the IC card. For many tourists, this can either be a Suica or PASMO (when landing in Tokyo) or an ICOCA (when landing in Kansai).

Note that you can only return a card in the region where you purchased it. If you land in Osaka, pick up an ICOCA, then travel to Tokyo and leave from there, you won't be able to return your ICOCA. Many people choose to keep their IC Cards as a souvenir or for future trips to Japan.

For the most part, the 10 major IC Cards are compatible with each other and can be used on [almost all rail systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_Mutual_Usage_Service). (Certain IC cards, such as the Traffica Kyoto Card or Surutto Kansai Miyako Card, are not compatible with other rail/transport systems.) However, the most commonly obtained cards described below are cross-compatible, meaning very few tourists will run into issues using one of the following cards during their trip, no matter which cities they visit.

**COMPATIBLE IC CARDS:**

*   [Suica](https://www.jreast.co.jp/e/pass/suica.html), issued by JR East in the Greater Tokyo, Niigata and Sendai regions. Local cards co-bearing Suica logo and compatible with major IC cards are issued by local railway and bus companies in Utsunomiya, Takasaki/Maebashi, Morioka, Aomori, Akita, Yamagata, Hachinohe and Odate areas,

*   [Hayakaken](https://www.japan-guide.com/g8/2359_hayakaken.gif), issued by Fukuoka City Subway
    

[Pitapa](https://www.japan-guide.com/g8/2359_pitapa.gif) is a postpaid card and is not available to tourists; it is very unlikely you will come across this card. However, it is also compatible with the aforementioned IC card services.

[Additional information on IC cards is available via Japan Guide](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2359_003.html).

**Please note that currently sales of both personalized and regular Suica and Pasmo cards have been suspended due to semiconductor shortage. If you arrive in the JR East area, use Welcome Suica or Passport Pasmo (28-day validity each) instead (acquired at Narita or Haneda Airports). See [this thread and its comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/15ebhwb/issuing_of_personalized_suica_and_pasmo_cards_is/) for a more detailed discussion.**

**If your stay in Japan extends beyond 28 days, consider getting an unaffected major IC card such as ICOCA when you get to the issuing region. Additionally, consider getting a mobile Suica, Pasmo, or ICOCA if your phone has the capability (see next section).**

### What is a digital IC card (Suica, Pasmo, ICOCA) and how do I get one?

Digital Suica, PASMO, and ICOCA cards can now be used on Apple iPhones (version 8 or later) and Apple Watches (version 3 or later). They can also be used on Android phones, but **only ones purchased in Japan**, which severely limits tourists from using mobile IC cards on their Android devices. [Here is the official page for Mobile Suica](https://www.jreast.co.jp/mobilesuica/index.html/).

If you have an Apple iPhone, you can simply add a Suica, PASMO, or ICOCA to your Apple Wallet by going into Wallet, tapping the plus sign (+) in the upper right, and adding it from the list of "Transit Cards". [Here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207154) is the general page for information and instructions, with specific instructions for adding the mobile card to Wallet [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207155). You can also transfer an existing physical Suica, PASMO, or ICOCA to your Apple iPhone (instructions in the previous links).

There's no need to get the official apps unless you need to check more detailed information on your card, such as its full serial number.

Mobile IC cards are recharged using a credit card from your Apple Wallet, although they can also be charged at machines within train stations, too. Mobile Suica and PASMO cards act the exact same as physical ones, and they have the same functionality.

**Please note that at this time, non-Japan issued Visa and Mastercard cards sometimes cannot be used to charge mobile IC cards. The most reliable card to use for refilling digital IC cards at this time is American Express.**

### I'm going to Tokyo. Should I get a Suica or a PASMO?

In Tokyo, the physical card you receive depends on the ticket machine from which you purchase your IC Card. JR ticket terminals sell Suica cards, while non-JR terminals (ie: Tokyo Metro, Keio, etc.) dispense PASMO cards. The only difference between Suica and PASMO is in name and appearance. One is not "better" than the other.

### How do I add money to my physical IC Card/Suica/PASMO etc.?

When utilizing the English language setting on a ticket machine, recharging an IC Card is fairly straightforward. Simply insert your IC Card into the proper slot on the machine, select the amount to be charged, insert the cash and retrieve your IC Card. All ticket machines will offer change in both bill and coin form if you insert more money than you would like to charge. (ie: If you only select ￥2000 to be added to your IC Card and insert a ￥10,000 bill, the machine will give you ￥8000 in change.) Some machines require the user to touch a "charge" confirmation button once money has been added to the machine.

Outside ticket machines, certain ATM's (eg. 7-Eleven) can be used to recharge your IC card via cash. They work in a similar way to the ticket machines found at the stations in IC-compatible areas.

[This guide from PASMO](https://www.pasmo.co.jp/en/use/charge/) details the process of recharging an IC Card using a PASMO machine step by step. This process is very similar across all major IC card machines. Videos on how to use other machines (ie: Suica, ICOCA) can be found online — however, the process is extremely simple and is best figured out in person. You might be surprised how easy using an IC card can be once you arrive in Japan!

If an IC card does not have enough balance to pay for a fare, passengers can add money to the card in the same manner by using a designated fare adjustment machine, which is usually located by each train station exit inside the ticket gates. Stations or exits without a fare adjustment machine require paying in person to the attendant manning the ticket gate. This is done by simply presenting your card to the attendant and paying the raiming balance in cash.

No. Physical IC Cards can only be charged with cash at an IC-compatible ticket machine or at convenience stores (also with cash).

### I need to transfer between lines to get to my destination. Will my IC card cover this ride?

Yes, assuming you have a balance on your IC card that covers the fare. If you do not have enough money on your card, you will need to add money to the card by using a ticket machine or fare adjustment machine.
