# My hotel is surrounded by 7-11, Lawson and FamilyMart. Which one has the best breakfast?

My definition of breakfast is very broad, so I could eat pretty much anything for breakfast. I'm picturing myself eating at least onigiri, natto(if they have it) and egg sando. Not really sure what other offerings there are at conbinis. What is your favorite conbini for breakfast?

(I am not in Japan yet so I can't check for myself)

### Comment 1

Try them all. Being the best is quite subjective.

### Comment 2

Is there a regular grocery store near your hotel?  They will have a wider range of foods, fresh, prepared, bakery, fruit and possibly even cheaper if that matters to you.

### Comment 3

Lawson Spicy Chicken for every meal.

### Comment 4

Go and find out! That's part of the fun.

### Comment 5

Try the egg sandwiches! Every convenience store has one. But my favourite is from Family Mart. Also, try the hard boiled eggs. Theyâ€™re the best youâ€™ll have ðŸ˜…. I also love convenience store fried chicken & corn dogs!
