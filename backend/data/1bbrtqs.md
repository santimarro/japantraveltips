# My 5th day in Japan, some fresh thoughts

Even though ceilings and doors may be quite small, beds so far have been comfortably large enough for me (Iâ€™m 6â€™8 or 205cm). Also, I get some looks but nobody seems phased for too long at my height. The only people that have asked about my height were people we had a casual conversation with beforehand. Very refreshing! 

Public transport and the Shinkansen are extremely easy to navigate. I was about anxious beforehand about what trains to board and how to bring luggage but so far everythingâ€™s good. It helps we got a Suica card at Narita airport as well. 

Speaking some Japanese goes a long way. We practiced about 300 days of Duolingo before getting here and itâ€™s paying off. Of course, itâ€™s not enough to have deep conversations but just using some basic phrases to ask for the restroom, the bill, where to buy train tickets have been useful. Also, Japanese donâ€™t expect it and we have seen people open up because of it. They try English and we try Japanese and it leads to great interactions. Iâ€™ve read that socialising with locals isnâ€™t a thing but so far we have had a great number of interactions because of our basic Japanese.

On that note, more people speak English (in the Tokyo area) than I thought. I heard it would be non-existent but itâ€™s not true at all. A lot of people also know basic phrases which is super helpful for getting around and ordering food.

Also, understanding basic etiquette/rules has been great as well. It is important to know when to queue, when to take off your shoes, to be quiet on public transport etc. Iâ€™ve seen a lot of Chinese, American tourists not following these rules and it makes me feel glad we did research beforehand. 

In general, this is the best trip of my life far. Canâ€™t wait to explore the rest of Japan for 3 more weeks!

Was on the train with some loud Americans down the car and I was so embarrassed for them ðŸ˜­ very oblivious to the glares they were receiving

But that's the thing â€” for those of us who live here, when we say that it's hard to get people to open up, we mean have deep conversations (even if we speak advanced to fluent Japanese). Everyone will seem chatty, pleasant and friendly if all you can say is, "Hello!", "Where is the bathroom?", "Thank you!" and such; it's a novelty, kind of like a child making conversation. I believe you'd have a much different experience in terms of finding people friendly with much more advanced Japanese. That barrier is difficult to break and takes repeat interactions with the same people over and over.

Day 300 in Japan, they still treat me like an alien. They can't stop staring. I can't have a normal conversation with anyone.

Okay, so where'd you get this from then?
