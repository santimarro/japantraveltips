# What's something you regret not doing during your last trip to Japan?

Mine would be not checking out more coffee shops in Tokyo. There is a massive range of high quality cafes in the city, from the down to earth to the upscale. I did get a chance to visit the Starbucks Reserve Roastery in Meguro - was incredible (if not a bit crowded).

I was lucky enough to be in Japan during covid. While I did see a bunch of lovely places without any tourists there, mainly all the big cities and most of the touristy places. Looking back on it, I should have done more. Having Japan all to yourself like that is never going to happen again. Being almost on your own at Kiyomizu or Sensoji is impossible now

I was there for 16 days but only ate 14 bowls of ramen, seems like a missed opportunity

Getting that vinyl from shibuya tower records. Can't seem to find it in other branches. T.T

### Comment 4

Not taking time to enjoy the train stations.

I wish I had gone off the beaten path more. On the last day of my most recent visit, I spent the day hopping on random trains and walking a ton, just seeing where I'd end up. Wound up in Jike Furusato Village near Aoba and had a beautiful walk through the rice fields / forested walkways there. 

It was so calming and I felt deeply connected with my environment. It's amazing how far you can go with such efficient public transport.
