# I have been an idiot with tax free shopping 


I am in Japan right now with my mum, I'm in the middle of a 6 month backpacking trip while she's visiting me for 2 weeks as a holiday. I bought some stuff at the Pokémon centre for her to take home for me and they asked if I had my passport and scanned some sticker on it. I didn't know about tax free shopping until then. I've just googled it and I'm not going to have the items I bought tax free upon departure as my mum is flying home with them in her suitcase and I'm flying to Vietnam separately to continue my travels and I do not have any room in my backpack at all for the items. Google is saying if you don't have the items you can be fined or imprisoned and I feel like an idiot because I didn't even know what the tax free shopping was and just agreed for them to scan my passport, I would've just paid the tax if I knew! Is there anything I can do in this situation?

Most of the time and if you aren't that suspicious, they won't check it nor have the manpower to do so

You should be fine. Just coming back from Tokyo. I had a similar situation and no one checked. They seem to only really look at big name brand purchases.  Japan isn’t going to try to stick you for pennies any chance they get. Maybe for peace of mind have your mom take a picture of the items and if worst comes to worst if you explain it they should be understanding. Im saying that so you have peace of mind and aren’t nervous, because it’s very unlikely they’re going to check.

I left Japan a couple of weeks ago and had bought loads of tax free stuff and they didn't even look twice. In theory you should scan your passport at a little 'tax free' desk at customs. My wife and I were the only ones that did so whilst everyone was just walking by with heaps of tax free stuff

Don't stress! My step dad only joined us for half the trip and then we brought his luggage home for him. He had bought plenty of stuff tax free under his passport-- it was not an issue.

I brought back roughly two suitcases full of tax free items. I scanned my passport at the little kiosk and that was it. They didn’t check at all. I was panicking because I had opened some packages and removed packaging to make it all fit, but it was totally fine.
