# budgeting

Although Japan has a reputation for being an expensive country to both visit and live in, this is a largely outdated stereotype that has become less true as Japan's economy has destabilized following the economic boom in the 1980s and as the cost of the yen has dropped relative to other major currencies. With proper planning and a good understanding of your average daily spending habits, it is entirely possible to visit Japan without breaking the bank — that is, unless you want to splurge on your trip!

Creating an inflexible and immutable budget is by no needs necessary. However, allowing yourself to develop a rough idea of how much you may need to bring on your trip is not only smart, but it may also prevent you from getting into troubling or stressful situations — especially for first-time travelers to Japan or those with little international travel experience. There's nothing worse than running out of money in the middle of a vacation.

Taking this into consideration, here are several things to keep in when crafting a budget for your trip to Japan:

*   Airfare to and from Japan
*   Pocket wi-fi or SIM card rental
*   Any long-distance train, air, or bus travel domestically within Japan (whether tickets or rail passes)
*   Local public transportation (trains, buses) within cities or towns
*   Rental car (if required)
*   Lodging (hotel, hostel, Airbnb, etc.)
*   Food/Drinks/Snacks
*   Attractions/Entry Fees/Activities/Sightseeing
*   Shopping/Souvenirs
*   Emergencies

Some people find it best to make a spreadsheet or use a dedicated budgeting app for planning purposes. At the very least, writing down what you expect to spend on each category prior to arriving in Japan will make your trip much easier.

### Budgeting in Large Cities (Tokyo, Osaka, Hiroshima, etc.)

Below are some sample prices for travel, attractions, food/drink, and items in larger cities in Japan.

#### Train and Bus Travel Within a City

**Trains**

Most local train systems work on a distance-based fare system, where the cost of your trip depends on how far you travel. A single ride will usually cost you anywhere from ￥140-￥550, although most tourists tend to travel shorter distances, making the average train ride cost on the lower end of that range. If you are planning on heavily utilizing trains for sightseeing, or if your lodging is further from main tourist areas, you should plan on taking at least 2-4 train rides per day.

Some common train routes and average fares for reference:

*   Shinjuku to Akihabara (Tokyo) - ￥170
*   Shinjuku to Harajuku (Tokyo) - ￥140
*   Shibuya to Ueno (Tokyo) - ￥200
*   Shibuya to Maihama (Tokyo Disney) - ￥420
*   Tokyo Station to Yokohama (Tokyo) - ￥470
*   Osaka Station to Tennoji (Osaka) - ￥190
*   Kyoto Station to Osaka Station (non-Shinkansen) - ￥560
*   Hiroshima Station to Miyajimaguchi (Hiroshima) - ￥410

**Buses**

Local bus lines either use flat-rate or distance-based fares, with the type of fare varying between bus operators and between cities. For example, many of the major bus services operating within the 23 Wards of Tokyo use a fixed-fare system. A good rule of thumb to determine whether a bus utilizes distance fares or flat fares is to note how passengers board the bus. Buses where passengers board at the front of the bus are generally flat-rate buses. Buses where passengers board from the middle or rear of the bus usually charge based on distance.

Average bus fares range from ￥100-250 for flat-rate buses and ￥190-350 for distance-based buses. Many communities also offer free local buses or shuttles.

**Long-Distance Train Travel / Shinkansen**

To calculate how much your shinkansen ticket will cost, you can either use [Jorudan](https://world.jorudan.co.jp/mln/en/) or the [JR Ticketing website](https://www.jreast.co.jp/e/ticket/reservation.html). A shinkansen ticket is made up of several fees:

*   **Base fare**: The fare to be paid to get from A to B. Increases step wise according to the distance traveled. Issued as a base fare ticket (乗車券).
    
*   **Shinkansen supplement (limited express fee)**: The supplement fee to be paid for using a shinkansen train (as opposed to a local train). The fee increases step wise according to the distance traveled. The express supplement is issued as a limited express fee ticket (特急券).
    
*   **Seat reservation fee**: ￥320/￥520/￥720 depending on whether it is low season, regular season or high season. An additional supplement (￥100-620 depending on distance traveled) applies for using reserved seats on Nozomi, Mizuho, Hayabusa and Komachi trains. The seat reservation fee is usually combined with the express supplement into a single ticket.
    
*   **Green car fee**: The supplement fee for riding the green car. Increases step wise according to the distance traveled. It is usually combined with the express supplement into a single ticket.
    

A passenger typically receives two pieces to their tickets (a base fare ticket and a supplement ticket), although in some situations the two tickets are combined into a single ticket. If multiple trains are involved, there can be more than two tickets (one supplement ticket for each train).

#### Lodging

*   ￥2000-3000/night (dirt cheap): For this price, you can stay in capsule hotels or youth hostels. A lodging like this will provide you a comfortable, basic, and safe place to sleep, without many amenities and with some downsides, like lack of space and needing to check out each day and find a place to store luggage.
*   ￥3000-6000/night (cheap): For this price, you can get a shared hostel, shared AirBnB, or possibly private AirBnB (in some more remote parts of major cities). At a lodging like this, you will most likely have a comfortable and safe place to stay, reasonable amenities, and fairly easy or easy access to public transit.
*   ￥6000-12000/night (moderate): For this price, you can get a private hostel room, private AirBnB, or no-frills business hotel room. At a lodging like this, you will most likely have a comfortable and safe place to stay in a central location, good amenities such as a 24-hour front desk and before-checkout/after-checkout luggage storage (at a hotel), and easy access to public transit.
*   ￥12000-18000/night (high): For this price, you can get a mid-tier "western style" hotel room, basic ryokan room, or private AirBnB rental. You will most likely have a plush and safe place to stay in a central location, great amenities such as good toiletries and a concierge (at a hotel), and easy access to public transit.
*   ￥18000+/night (luxury/splurge): For this price, you can get basically any good hotel room in any location you'd like. If you are looking for a luxury hotel in a central location or a fancy ryokan (such as one with in-room onsen bath), your prices will probably end up higher than ￥18000.
