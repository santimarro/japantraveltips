# What is your favorite 7/11 food?

So far my favorite is the Tiramisu.  What do you buy?


### Comment 1

Not really food per se, but I like their smoothie using the in-store blending machine

### Comment 2

Got tipsy after a few drinks at a bar. Went in 7-11 in Japan and asked for 4 boneless fried chiken.

Their chiken were amazing!

### Comment 3

Pretty simple choices but never a let down - curry bread & a spicy mayo fried chicken onigiri. Always a solid late night snack for me.

### Comment 4

Cheese steamed cake. What I ate for breakfast everyday while I was there

### Comment 5

The pork, egg and chilli oil onigiri is my current obsession
