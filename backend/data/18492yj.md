# I feel like people in Osaka are purposefully banging into me with force is this a thing?

Currently in Osaka. Arrived yesterday and within 24 hours Iâ€™ve been banged into around 10 times with force thatâ€™s so strong Iâ€™m feeling like it has to be on purpose? 

Iâ€™ve been traveling around Japan for weeks and visited Tokyo, Kyoto and Hiroshima and not experienced anything like it. Iâ€™m also solo traveling and very aware of making sure I donâ€™t get into anyoneâ€™s space and if I do I apologise. 

Iâ€™m a solo female traveler and itâ€™s getting frustrating. Earlier today one so bad happened that the man doing it used a trolley type thing and it knocked me over. When I fell over people around me helped me up and he didnâ€™t even look at me or acknowledge heâ€™d done it. 

Is this a common thing in Osaka or am I blindly doing something wrong without realising it? Iâ€™d like to figure out as I feel like iâ€™m constantly on edge ðŸ˜­ and being in a foreign country alone, it doesnâ€™t seem worth standing up for myself.

Not just common, it has a name in japanese. "Butsukariya"

Sorry but it looks like you got unlucky, they target women.

### Comment 2

Do not retaliate. They have guilty until proven innocent system and will be biased against you.

### Comment 3

I had this happen to me in the Tokyo Station (5'2" white woman) and I learned very quickly to do the "linebacker" manuever. When you see it coming, hunch down and put your shoulder forward. Noticed the perpetrator men are shocked by that. Happens a lot when going between trains when they think they can walk it off in the other direction without repercussion.

In 2015, visiting Japan for 2 months, I was shoved very hard against my right shoulder while walking inside an underground train station in Tokyo. It was a Japanese male who shoved me intentionally for no reason. I look Japanese but Iâ€™m not. So I think it can happen to any vulnerable-looking female, western or not. Iâ€™m still pissed about it and disappointed itâ€™s still happening 8 years later in 2023. Donâ€™t the Japanese have other ways of relieving stress?
