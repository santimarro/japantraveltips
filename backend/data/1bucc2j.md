# What’s your favorite station to stay near in Tokyo?

For both living and visiting, the Kōenji station area off the Chūō line has always been my favorite. There is a lot that goes on there for festivals and plenty of food options but it’s still more relaxed than a lot of other areas. 

I want to hear what yours is.

Shinagawa Station.

### Comment 2

Akihabara. Love this station, it’s fascinating- so peaceful & serene  like most places ( despite the crowds), so many interesting shops, beautiful bakeries, great supermarkets, cafes in and around, and there’s a brilliant hotel next to it, the JR East Mets. Also the Yamonate line. And it’s so clean and easy to navigate, plus one stop Ueno, and two stops to Tokyo.

### Comment 3

I'm super biased about Ueno station. I just love the vibe of the area.

### Comment 4

Ueno! Love the gritty sort of vibe of the area. Night life is incredible. The station is super well connected, and the park is so nice!

### Comment 5

The stretch between Koenji and Kokubunji is great but you have to plan your itinerary around peak Chuo Line congestion.



I like staying around Ueno / Okachimachi.
