# Don't overthink your travel plans.

I often read meticulously planned travel itineraries here. I have visited Japan several times and Tokyo for example is the ideal place to just visit "on the go" without planning to much. I will visit again in late May, staying for around 10 days. My plan is to book 3 hotels in different parts of Tokyo for 3-4 nights each and go from there. You can find so many interesting things just by walking the neighborhoods and briefly having a look on google maps. Even in times before smartphones, just with a map it was perfect for spontaneous adventures. Regarding food, I never plan to visit specific restaurants, there are so many options on the way. Be spontaneous.

p.s. on my last trip my luggage was lost by the airline and was delivered to the hotel 2 days later. In Japan it is so easy to travel, even without luggage, as the hotels provide toothbrushes and everything you need. Even with no change of clothes, I just went and bought stuff for 2 days and had it reimbursed later by the airline. Don't overthink. On my next trip I will minimize my luggage, there are washing mashines in most hotels as well.

All true but you're forgetting that for some people, a trip to Japan may be a once-in-a-lifetime trip that they can't afford to be so relaxed and spontaneous and don't want to miss certain things.

I do agree that any plans should allow breathing space and that Japan is very easy for the reasons you mention.

There's a balance haha, I can't go in blind because I have only 2 weeks and I have no idea when I would go to Japan again. Also honestly going without a plan is boring to me, I just would look up things to do in the area anyway which I might as well do from home since some things require reservations.

This is honestly some of the best advice one can give on this sub, and it highlights how detrimental subs like r/JapanTravel post guidelines are for 1st-time travelers.

There is virtually zero reason to book all of your trains in advance, stress over reservations, etc. when it's *so* easy to get tangentially lost all across the country and still have an incredible time.

IMO, book 2-3 "must-see-with-reservation" experiences tops, but don't kill yourself over minmaxxing a vacation otherwise.

All great points here, including OP.  I think it’s just personality type. My recent trip to Japan may be the last chance I will ever have for various reasons. Still, these tightly planned itineraries are horrifying to me… because that’s who I am. I don’t care as much about specific sites, I care about the feel of a place and the surprises I find. I know I will miss things in doing it this way but that’s okay with me because planning just means you’ll miss different things from doing it THAT way. Some people get joy from seeing exactly what they set out to see and that’s cool! The only “tragedy” is that life is short and the world is too big and amazing to ever see it all. Also that we have to have jobs!!

Everyone travels differently.  

Who is anyone to say how they should plan or not plan or plan to the hour? If planning to the hour makes people comfortable with their trip then fine.  OP has 3 different hotels in 10 days.  I think that’s crazy, but they like it like that.

Let people do it their own way.  Now if you want to hit up Asakusa and Shibuya on one day and Ueno and Shinjuku on the next, I might suggest you save time and look at a map.  Or, if you think a day trip to Sapporo from Tokyo is wise….

Now, if we could all stop freaking about breaking the seal on the tax-free bags…
