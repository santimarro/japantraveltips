# Japanese kids keep calling my dad “Mickey Mouse”. What does that mean? Is it a derogatory/racist term?

I’ve been in Japan with my family for over a week now and it’s been mostly a great trip, however Japanese kids keep calling my dad “Mickey Mouse”. It happens all over Tokyo. In public places like Ginza, in elevators, at our hotel, and even at teamLab Planets. Sometimes the kids point and laugh, other times they just say it. Sometimes their parents grab them and try to shut the kids up and other times the parents do nothing. I haven’t been called anything derogatory. Neither have my sister or mom. It’s only my dad getting name called. It’s getting annoying at this point and I hope this term doesn’t have any racist connotations (we’re a Black American family). Any info on this would be helpful. How should my dad respond the next time he’s called “Mickey Mouse”?

UPDATE: Now we’re thinking they meant “Ikimasu” which means “go”.

It’s definitely not a Thing…does your dad look like Mickey Mouse? Cause I mean the chances of more than one person saying this 🫠

### Comment 2

Does he laugh with a “huh-HuH” sound?

### Comment 3

You obviously have to come with a pic of your dad…you know, for science.

### Comment 4

I’ve never, ever heard of that. Maybe try saying to the parents, “Why Mickey Mouse? Why??” And maybe they will be able to explain?? It’s very strange. I can only imagine the kids are all watching the same tv program hosted by someone who kinda looks like your dad??

Does your dad walk around in red overalls with gold buttons and wear white gloves? If so….
