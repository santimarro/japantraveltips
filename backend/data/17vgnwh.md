# What are your favorite things to do in Osaka? Day and night activities!

I'm so excited to spend three days in Osaka. I'm having a hard time deciding what to do and if it's worth a day trip to Nara or Kobe, or if I should spend it all in Osaka! Having said that, what are your favorite things to do in Osaka?

Go to Den-Den town (Akihabara of Osaka) during the day; if you're simping for anime figures or Amerika-Mura for Japanese Street Fashion (Harajuku of Osaka). 

At night, go hit Dotombori, hit the speakeasy bars (Bar Shiki, Bar Nayuta, Bible Club Osaka, Bar Matsuda, etc). Go Shinsekai, then go stroll Tobita Shinchi LOL (I took my wife and mother in law there last week, showed them what I used to do in my 20s before I married my wife)

Umeda Sky Building has a fantastic view of the city if you're not afraid of heights. The Osaka Pirate dinner cruise is fun, lots of good food while you cruise the sights. If you are interested in youth culture, visit America-mura for fashion and street food. If you like unusual, visit Isshin-ji, where the massive sculptures at the entrance are made from the ashes of tens of thousands of followers. Those are the things that come to mind besides the obvious, like Dotonbori and Universal Studios.

I loved just walking around Dotonbori and eating everything in sight.

I really like the aquarium

If you’re a plant or nature lover, we went over to Awaji island for the Kiseki No Hoshi botanical garden and surrounding gardens. Insane architecture and i believe it’s one of Japans biggest botanical gardens?
The whole place looks like a Bond villain headquarters, it’s otherworldly!
Otherwise I’ll echo what the others said - eating in Dotonburi, and maybe exploring Shinsekai area for food and drink?
