# Airport has stopped selling new suica cards! Landed Mar 22 2024

Tldr: no more suica at the airport, pasmo at keisei info desk only, lines can be long. Plus side is you get a cute Sanrio card as a souvenir. Story of my experience 2 days ago. 

Just got to Japan a couple of days ago and terminal 2/3 at NRT was an absolute zoo. We're staying in nippori so bought keisei tickets in advance, it's a direct shot. I highly recommend staying near where the airport train takes you (any station along the Skyliner or n'ex). Having to figure out how to transfer trains after a 12 hr flight is not my idea of a fun time. The plan was to land, get a suica for my husband (I still have a valid one), pick up the keisei Skyliner tickets we pre purchased online, and leave. Esim already done, I've been here before, thought we were good. 

The lines! It took us half an hour to find the sign saying they no longer sold new suica cards. The confused masses of ppl did not help. The keisei info desk was the only one selling an IC card (pasmo passport, Â¥1500 cash only) so we waited 35 min in line because they were understaffed, and confused tourists take time. I get it. I could've gone to an electronic kiosk which had the same # of ppl lined up but going faster. I'm part of the problem here 'cause we need an IC card. We're not staying at a major station and plan to be taking a local bus in the morning. By the time we left the line, it was twice as long as when we got in it. So I guess the lesson here is try to at least walk fast, split up, and beat the ppl from your flight if you can. Tbf I also think our flight arrived concurrently with two other international flights, so my experience could be the exception. 

We exited customs/airport around 4pm, that was super smooth sailing, and barely made the 5:45 train out. 1.5 hours to be in one line and pick up a 7-11 onigiri was not the end of the world but more than this pregnant lady was feeling for. 

As a side note - I felt like a subject matter expert as 2-3 confused families overheard me explaining the bookings to husband, and asked me their questions. Lady, I can relay the info from the 3 YouTube videos I watched, but I got no idea how you're going to get to this -name of random place-.

NRT stopped selling Welcome Suica cards months ago. I forget exactly when, but it's not listed [on their page](https://www.jreast.co.jp/multi/en/welcomesuica/welcomesuica.html) anymore as a location and I remember updating the sticky thread here with the info. I think it was December?

If you were passing through Ueno Station anyhow, a better option might have been to get yourself into the city (since you already had Skyliner tickets), and stop at the Ueno Station commuter pass center for a Pasmo Passport. There are also limited sales of regular Suica and Welcome Suica happening in larger Tokyo JR stations, although you can't rely on that right now, since it's intermittent.

So is the keisei info desk the only option for an IC card? Im arriving at Narita May 3rd and I DO NOT have an Iphone (tired of people just telling me to get it on my Apple wallet). That's inconvenient T.T

### Comment 3

Did you fly into Narita? The website has disclaimer that welcome Suica cards were no longer sold. I got the suica card in my Apple wallet

### Comment 4

Bought a regular suica (not the welcome) 1st march at the JR east office in the airport (where you take your JR pass, didn' needed one). Saw the awfull lines for express train ticket and just used my suica to take the local all-stops line. No queue, was gone from airport in less than 15 min.

I'm never giving up my 2 suica and 4 Pasmo cards which I've accumulated from past trips!
