# Found full bloom cherry blossoms in Tokyo 

For everyone else disappointed in Tokyo's late cherry blossom season (as of 3/31) - 

Check out Roka Koshun'en Garden. About 35 min via Keio line from Shinjuku. All 12 trees there are currently full bloom, as well as tulips and canola flowers! Also enjoyed the break from crazy crowds. 

Otherwise - Shinjuku Gyoen has many (the largest clusters were around the formal garden). Saw a handful in Ueno Park.

Do you have any photos? I would like to see as Iâ€™m not in Tokyo yetðŸ˜­

Very happy for late bloom, my trip was April 5-16 and was afraid I'd miss out but looks like I will be perfect after all.

Landing in Osaka 10th April. Any hint ?
