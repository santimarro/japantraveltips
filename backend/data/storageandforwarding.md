For those travelers with luggage waiting for their lodging's check-in time, luggage may be able to be kept at the front desk or in a secured room at the hotel or hostel. This is a relatively common practice, so please inquire with your lodging facility prior to check-in.

For travelers waiting for Airbnb check-in, train departures, or who cannot store luggage at a place of lodging, **coin lockers** are generally available at all train stations. The price of lockers varies based on size and can range from ¥300 to ¥800. Some lockers are cash-only and will only accept coins, while others will accept IC Card payment (i.e.: Suica, PASMO) or larger bills.

It is very important to note that the size and availability of lockers can vary between stations. While many major and semi-major stations offer large lockers (usually big enough to hold a 27" suitcase), many local or smaller stations do not. Additionally, the selection of lockers at major stations will be extremely limited on weekends or holidays. Large lockers are popular with both foreign and Japanese travelers, so these lockers tend to fill up quickly. Do not rely upon the availability of lockers and have a back-up plan or back-up station for your luggage storage.

The majority of lockers in Japan are only available for day use, with items removed at a set time — although some lockers allow patrons to store items for 36, 48, or 72 hours, depending on the location. Read the signs posted on lockers to ensure you do not have your items removed. If you're not sure, then it's most likely your locker is intended for day use and all effort should be made to retrieve your belongings before ~11pm.

Travelers visiting Shinjuku, Tokyo Station, Tokyo Sky Tree, Asakusa, and a few other major tourist areas may also utilize [baggage storage service from Sagawa Express](https://www.sagawa-exp.co.jp/ttk/english/service/tenimotsu.html), a major Japanese courier service.

### How can I forward my luggage to the airport or to my next destination?

Several delivery companies offering luggage forwarding services operate throughout Japan, including: [JALABC](https://www.jalabc.com/english/), [Yamato Transport (Kuroneko)](https://www.global-yamato.com/en/hands-free-travel/scene02.html), and [Sagawa Express](https://www.sagawa-exp.co.jp/ttk/english/). In Kansai, [Crosta](https://handsfree-japan.com/index_en.html) is a relatively new luggage forwarding service targeting tourists visiting Kyoto and Osaka. These services generally deliver luggage and other parcels to airports, hotels, residences, and convenience stores — making them a convenient option for travelers who do not want to carry their bags while transiting throughout Japan.

Items can be sent from baggage forwarding service stations located at airports, at locations of the forwarding service (e.g., a Kuroneko Yamato office/counter), from hotels, in shopping malls, and in most convenience stores and supermarkets. If you are shipping to or from a hotel, check your hotel's website to see how they handle luggage forwarding – it's often listed as a service or as part of an FAQ page.

Travelers can specify the date and time for bags to arrive at their final destination up to 7 days after pick-up. Delivery is generally completed within one to two days, with an extra day required for remote areas like Hokkaido and Okinawa.

When sending bags from the airport, most travelers should be able to receive their luggage on the same day, depending on the area. When sending luggage **to** the airport however, it will need to do be done at least **2 to 3 days prior to departure**. For airport luggage forwarding, prices range from about ¥2000-¥4000 per item, depending on the size.

### What if I am staying at an Airbnb or other lodging that will not accept luggage forwarding for me?

In order to forward luggage, the destination needs to be able to accept luggage. Many hotels, hostels, and ryokan will do this. Airbnb hosts or other small establishments might not. If that is the case for one of your lodgings, you can send the luggage to a nearby counter for pick-up (depending on the luggage forwarding company you are using). Here you can find a [list of Yamato counters](https://www.global-yamato.com/en/hands-free-travel/facilities/) and a [list of Sagawa counters](https://www.sagawa-exp.co.jp/ttk/english/service/tenimotsu.html).
