# What is a food or restaurant that you loved so much you still dream about today?

A certain place's gyoza, the most mouth watering curry, the ramen bowl that keeps you up at night craving for more. Stuff like this!

Went to a pre season baseball game in Tokyo and ordered a soba ramen. I was annoyed because it took so long. When it came I realized they put so much love into making it. Best ramen of my life!

I have said this one before but I love this so much - egg salad sandwiches at either 7-11 or Family Mart. They are soooooo good.

Cheese tarts at Kinotoya. Itâ€™s based in Hokkaido but I think thereâ€™s one open in Tokyo. Itâ€™s beautiful
