# No Pasmo or suica? 

**tldr**: if you want IC card at Narita, check all the booths (not just Keisei). Androids not from US CANNOT use Google pay for transit. If you can't get the card from airport, check Keisei, Jr east travel center, or tourist information booths at train stations - apparently, the further you get from Tokyo station, the higher the probability of you getting an IC card. 

I thought tourists could grab a Pasmo passport or temporary suica but we landed at Narita airport last night and they told us we had to go to Ueno station to get one. At Ueno station we went to the tourist center, keisei line, and Jr booth and all said that there was only mobile app (I have Android). I decided to go to Tokyo station and they also said only mobile. Anyone have any advice or insight on how to get a suica or Pasmo? 

**Update:** based on comments, it looks like you'll have better luck getting a Pasmo passport (tourist Pasmo) or suica from the JR ticket office at Narita. I cannot confirm myself. **Also, stop telling me to get it on my phone. I cannot because I have a US based android (Pixel 7 pro).**

Also, it seems like card availability can vary by day. I'm going to try again at one of the JR east travel offices sometime later today and will report back.

Multiple people also said that they had luck finding suica cards (non tourist) at Shibuya and Shinjuku stations. If I can't get one from Tokyo/Ueno stations, I will try there next. Otherwise I'll just wait until I get to Kyoto and try to get an IC card there. 

**Update 2:** was able to finally get a Pasmo passport at Yokohama station. I was navigating using tickets (very nerve wracking) and thought I'd try the jr east travel center here. The lady directed me to the information booth. I misunderstood and went to the tourist booth on the 2f. The lady there told me and showed me on the map that I needed to go to the Keisei information booth on the b1 level. You will see a pink banner for the Pasmo passport.

Got my Pasmo Passport 2 weeks ago at Shinjuku metro station. Specifically at Shinjuku-Nishiguchi station at E01.  Go down and there's a tourist info office with a robot out front.  Ask them and they will take you down another level to get the card.  The 500JPY is waived so it costs 1500JPY (amount the card is loaded with) for an absolutely adorable hello kitty pasmo passport card.

At Ueno and Tokyo station did you go to the ticket office or the JR East Service Center?

Phyiscial Suica cards are currently available at JR East Travel Service Centers.

In Japan on vacation now. Welcome Suica cards are only available at airports. We got Pasmo Passports by going to one of the locations on the website (https://www.pasmo.co.jp/visitors/en/buy/). An associate had to review our passports to make sure we had our stamp, etc. and could only pay cash.

Sale of commuter Suica has been suspended since August 2023 (ETA: because of chip shortage) so only tourists ones are being issued new. In the meantime while you donâ€™t have a tourist IC, the magnetic strip tickets that you dip into the slot at machines are necessary.
