Clear immigration.

I just landed today, what I did.

1: Used the visit Japan website to expedite the immigration control, saves you time ahead for sure, saw lots of people from my flight that just got into the line when i got out of it.

2: Picked up my pocket wifi from ninja wifi, took less than 2 minutes.

3: Got into a taxi that took all the luggage and me to the hotel, this was a complementary service from booking.com and was a free perk i got after booking my hotel with them.
From what i could see luggage shipping was very easy for others that didnt use a taxi and the signs for the metro/railway were all easy to follow.

4: Checked in, used the Japanese toilet and took a shower.

5: Took a walk in the area (asakusabashi), are some ramen and drunk some beer, bought some snacks at a 7-11, back at the hotel and ready to go to sleep now, teamlabs tomorrow!

Hope you have a good time here OP!

If you have an iPhone, you can preload a Suica/pasmo/icoca into your Apple Wallet. Load your card with either an Amex or Mastercard if visa is still being silly and blocking it.

If you’re phone is unlocked you can use an eSIM like airalo, so that when you land you can activate it immediately otherwise you’ll probably have to get a SIM card or pocket wifi.

If you’re getting a jr pass, I would go there first as the lines can build up quickly and it moves quite slow. 

Since you’re coming from Haneda it should be fairly easy but have an idea of how you’re getting to your hotel from the airport.

Get your welcome Suica card.

### Comment 5

Acquire ramen and beer.
