# Woman solo - sad trip?

Solo traveller in Japan

I was planning a Japan trip for this summer, with a friend, but I believe my friend is having cold feet and will make an excuse.

I have never traveled alone and I am scared of making that step.

I would be very much grateful to read experiences, advices, and thoughts on solo traveling in Japan. I need to think about what to do, and advices on safety, finances and experiences for a solo female traveler would be very appreciated. 

Thank you in advance

Hi! I actually just got back from Japan - like a day ago after visiting for 2 weeks!
You will be totally fine! I never felt unsafe except one time in the Kabukicho area. But like any place you go just be aware of your surroundings. I must say though out of all the countries I‚Äôve traveled to solo, in Japan I definitely felt the safest. Being from New York, I felt Tokyo and elsewhere was pretty inexpensive, I did a lot of shopping and treated myself to decently priced dinners, but they still didn‚Äôt break the bank. And I feel like eating and doing things solo is quite common in Japan, I think that helped me ease my nerves.

I say all that to say, just do it! You can‚Äôt wait on other people because if we did, we would be stuck at home lol. I say go for it, and you will be happy you did!

I don't prefer traveling alone, but it beats traveling with an unwilling travel partner.

Hi! I‚Äôm a woman who moved to and lived in Japan by myself from age 24-26 and even I felt some anxiety last year when I booked a solo trip (I‚Äôm 38 now). There was no practical reason to feel anxious, Japan is extremely safe, easy to navigate, and right now is pretty affordable, but feeling nervous before a solo trip is totally normal. It turned out to be the most epic and amazing trip ever, so if you want to go, please don‚Äôt let your fear hold you back! Feel free to dm me if you have any travel questions, you may travel solo but you‚Äôre not alone :)

Hey there; As I'm typing this, I'm on my way to the airport to catch my flight back home from Japan and I'm so sad to leave. This was my first solo trip as a female traveller.

Please please go for it! My only regret is that I didn't do this sooner. 

There's so much to do and see. Everyone I met -locals and other solo travellers- has been so lovely to me. If you're unsure about doing things independently, for the first day in each city(Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka), I recommend doing the free walking tour by Japan Localized. I especially enjoyed the Shinjuku night tour in Tokyo. It's a great opportunity to explore the red light district in the safety of a group. I loved the walking tours because they gave me a quick overview into a city, which I could freely explore later. I also met with many other solo female travellers that I'll definitely be keeping in touch with. 

This was the greatest gift I gave myself.
