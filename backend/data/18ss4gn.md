# Some random tips/advice I have for impulsive travelers headed to Japan and things I wish I'd known before coming (post writing, wall of text warning)

I'll try to organize them somewhat, but in no particular order:  
  
#Traveling within Japan  
- Use the luggage forwarding service. Don't be me. Don't get on the rush hour monorail and then Yamanote Line with your huge bag. You know that video you saw on YouTube that wanted to tell you about luggage forwarding? The one you kind of shrugged off? Don't sleep on it. It honestly isn't that expensive all things considered (can be only moderately more expensive than luggage reservation seats on the Shinkansen) and it makes your life massively easier. Pack an overnight bag and travel easy  
- Apps that help you buy tickets are nice and can make things easier, but the experience/labeling can differ dramatically between somewhere like Tokyo Station and Kyoto Station, for long distance travel give yourself some buffer time  
- There is zero way a plane from Haneda/Narita is easier to take than the Shinkansen to Kyoto or Osaka unless you're literally landing and direct connecting. The train system in this country is arguably the best transit systems I've used in my entire life  
- You are over packing. No, you're over packing. Oh, you're planning on doing shopping? You're *horrendously* over packing. Unless you're landing and going to straight to Hokkaido to do some snowboarding cut most of the stuff in your bag out. If you're staying a few weeks try and book an aparthotel or a place with a washer/dryer at least (there are many of them) and travel lighter, even with luggage forwarding  
- You don't need to put that much money on your Welcome IC card. No trust me, you don't, it is easy to top up as you go. Just because there is a line behind you and you're overwhelmed after a 10 hour flight don't let that trick you into throwing 5,000 yen on there  
- The further you climb up (insert thing here) from the train station/tourist trap at the bottom the better time you'll have. The last 20 minutes hiking Mt. Inari was one of the most beautiful experiences of my life. The 30,000 people at the bottom of the hill (had I not come in from a side direction randomly) might have turned me off the entire experience  
  
#Busy Times/Store Hours  
- Randomly on this trip some holidays have been way more busy than I expected, so keep that in mind. Christmas isn't a huge deal in the same way it is in the US/Europe, but it is a pretty busy shopping holiday so many of the stores will be packed with exclusive Christmas sales. Christmas Eve is a big night for couples, similar to Valentine's Day, so it may be hard to get a table at that fancy place you wanted to eat. New Year's is a huge deal at the Shrines all over the country, but the lead up *to New Year's* is a huge travel time for people. This means the Shinkansen goes to reservation only seats, hotel prices skyrocket, etc. - plan ahead! The same hotel I was looking at for New Year's Eve a month ago was less than half the price for the same room as it is today  
- You may not be able to help it, but if you *can* land and get to Tokyo proper outside of rush hour you'll be a lot less in people's way  
- In a lot of the busy tourist areas/shopping centers many places didn't open until 10/11 AM, the only place I could really hang out in Akihabara was Tully's until about that time  
- In Kyoto a bunch of food places open for lunch, close, and then reopen for dinner. If your schedule is stuck in a weird hybrid like mine was or you're a person that takes a late lunch anyway you might be extremely limited on what you can grab based on time of day and forced into things you didn't want like McDonald's  
  
#Food/Eating  
- I, out of pure American curiosity, had to try at least two fast food places while here just to see how they were. Carl's Jr. was *massively* better than it is in the states. Wendy's was *massively* worse. It can be fun, but sometimes it hurts a bit to see what we've exported  
- Reviews will be your friend on knowing how easy it will be to eat at/order at a place if you're solo and only speak English. Almost everyone I ran into was more than willing to at least work through a translator app to help ease the process, but a few places really didn't want to deal with it or the hassle. One place in Kyoto just straight told me "too busy for app" and literally asked me to leave  
- Tons of places will tell you not to tip but on establishments directly attached to hotels I certainly saw tip cards/tip lines starting to pop up, so this might be trending in the wrong direction  
- 7-Eleven / Lawsons / other convenience stores will have a lot of what you need, a lot of good snacks, and a lot better/healthier selection than in the states. If you are staying at an aparthotel though for more than a few days and plan on potentially doing some cooking outside the microwave you'll want to find a grocery store near by because outside a few day stay it'll get old pretty quick  
- If you don't know what something is, just ask politely. Almost every place I've eaten was excited to explain the house specialty or set meal, many even asked if I had allergies or anything to worry about. The food culture here is fantastic and a lot of the places really do love to share it  
  
#Hotels/Stays  
- I highly recommend unless you're prepping for a connection or getting in extremely late to not stay directly at major station or airport. You'll find far more authentic experiences if you get off the most obvious tourist path  
- I highly recommend staying at least a few nights in a hotel that leans more traditionally Japanese. You don't have to go straight to a Ryokan that has curfew hours, etc., but there is something pretty calming about slippers and tatami I'm going to miss  
- That being said, if you have large feet you may want to invest in a decent pair of travel slippers before coming, or while here. I wear a size 11.5 US and only one hotel I stayed in had slippers that didn't border on busting through  
- Every hotel I stayed at was far better appointed than most places in the US. Each and every one of them had robes, slippers, full toiletries kits, *free* water bottles, a fridge (mini or otherwise), tea, electric kettle, mugs, coffee, etc., hospitality is alive and well in Japan  
- If using a 3rd party booking site and prepaying you will likely have to pay a room tax in the major tourist cities still when you check in. It is generally based on the room rate and location, in Tokyo it was 200 Yen a night (very cheap), however in Kyoto mine was 500 Yen a night over a much longer stay so this was a little unexpected, both wanted cash since I'd already paid for the room  
- Every place I went (this includes stores) was hotter inside than I thought it would be, but most of the water was a bit cooler, just something to note. I'd be walking around in a hoody or button up most days and walking into a store and just dying in the heat inside, this includes hotel rooms. My room when I checked in at Tokyo was set to 27C which was mind-blowingly warm to me. When I got Kyoto it was 28C. I went and made sure there was no weird thing in my booking profile but no, they just had the heat cranked  
  
#English Speaking Areas  
- There is less English here than you think, even in the touristy areas. A lot of places that speak it, and speak it well, and advertise that they do, will be a bit more expensive because they're marketing to that specific crowd  
- The further off the main tourist tracks you get the less English there will be, this includes posted signage  
- This does get into a weird grey area where there are a lot of shops that have "NO PICTURES/NO VIDEO" posted all around because they don't want people cross shopping prices, posting stock, etc., but you may need to translate; just ask before you start pulling the phone out (one example I have of this specifically is when I went to Mandarake in Akihabara to do some game hunting - I'd seen the signs so I asked before if I could use my phone to translate some games and the clerk said sure - someone else came in and was just waiving their phone around and got snapped at - he tried to say he was translating but the clerk said no you're taking video and asked him to leave)  
- If everyone is speaking fluent English where you're shopping you're probably going to pay a lot more for whatever you're buying than it will be even one shop over; this isn't a hard rule and there are certainly exceptions with individual staff but if the menu/info is more in English than Japanese just be aware  
- If you're struggling don't fear the translation app. Yes it potentially makes you look like you're a lost tourist but I had at least two moments on this trip where I tried to struggle through an explanation in broken horrific Japanese and got nowhere only to use the translation app and instantly have the other person excitedly understand and assist me  
- I did ask one person in a store where I had a question if he spoke any English because I was trying to to find a specific Christmas gift for my SO, and the translations I'd looked at weren't quite getting it right (proper nouns), to which the guy replied "Wow that's racist as hell I'm from California" - when I apologized he laughed and said "I guess I am Japanese though" and just started laughing like crazy - Don't be that guy  
- The flip side to that though is a tourist came up to me later and asked me a question in German and when I explained I'm American he scoffed so guess it happens to the best of us  
  
Hope any of the above helps anyone on their way to an amazing trip!

Amazing tips all around but if you have the Suica in your Apple Wallet (and don’t plan on getting a welcome Suica at the airport) you should put A LOT on it initially — I set everything up before my trip and had no issues, however I haven’t been able to top up after I arrived (apparently this is a known issue) and I’ve had to use cash. I’ve ran into several other people encountering the same problem. 

This isn’t the end of the world, but the first day when I could just use my phone for trains was incredible. I wish I had put on an extra ¥10,000 yen before I landed

It is true that shops usually open at 10-11am, but many attractions including castle, temple/shrine, museum, garden, etc will open at 9-10 am before that you have less options of things that open earlier or just never close like parks and some temple/shrine. For example in Akihabara you could go to Kanda-myojin.

Not all Shinkansen turn to reserve only for new year, only the nozomi and this year was the first they did it. But at all time there is some limited express and Shinkansen that are reserved only.

### Comment 3

Disagree on the IC card. I actually did not personally do this, but picked this tip up from friends smarter than myself: go ahead and throw 5000 yen on it. Then go ahead it and use it to pay for everything. Conbini, lunch, whatever. Beats dealing with coins.

Even better tip: Slap a Suica on your iPhone. Easy top ups. The latest iOS update fixes the block on Visa; I just got mine two days ago. (Actually haven't used it yet but looking forward to my new coinless life.)

Also I am not really sure how the occupancy tax works exactly but it seems to be property-dependent rather than booking company dependent. Just booked three different hotels in Tokyo and Kyoto using two different sites, all prepaid, no extra fee upon check-in for any of them. Fourth hotel (in Kyoto) wanted 200 yen per person per night. I can't find an explanation for the discrepancy.

Also this tip may not get vacationers very far, but sometimes the walk-in cash rate at hotels is cheaper than if you prepay online. You can always call and ask but the receptionist might not speak English.

The "too busy for app" got me 🤣

I can totally picture the grandpa kind of guy that would say that. Thank you for the detailed advice, it sounds like you had a little bit of an adventure over there.

### Comment 5

Hiking up Mount Inari in the evening was one of the highlights of the trip. We were absolutely rammed at the bottom, but by the time we were 1/3 of the way up it was near empty.
