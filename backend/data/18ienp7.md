# Just Returned from Japan with Kids: Here’s What I Learned!



Hey all,

Just rounding out our Japan trip where we are travelling with my two kids, aged four and ten, and I wanted to share my experience and some tips. We focused on the Yokohama, Kawasaki, and Tokyo areas to avoid long-distance travel. Here’s what I learned:

1. **Shoes Matter**: Bring comfortable walking shoes. I learned this the hard way with fashion shoes and ended up limping into a store for a 19000 yen rescue pair! Birkenstocks to the rescue.

2. **Jet Lag with Kids**: It took us almost five days to adjust to the time difference. If you’re traveling with young kids, use the first few days to rest. I had to carry my four-year-old a lot at first.

3. **Stroller Pros and Cons**: A stroller can be both useful and a hindrance in Japan. It's great for tired kids, but a challenge in crowded areas and when using elevators.

4. **Transportation**: We skipped luggage forwarding and used a mix of taxis and trains. Taxis are great for moving luggage between hotels and the airport.

5. **Breakfast Buffets**: A lifesaver for variety and a good start to the day. Staying at hotels with a good breakfast buffet is a must.

6. **Shopping Tips**: Clothes are significantly cheaper than in North America. Electronics? Not so much.

7. **Travel Smart with Suica on iPhone**: For easy transit, load a Suica IC card on your iPhone. For kids, get the Welcome Suica card and make sure it’s well-funded to avoid constant reloads. Sorry Android users, no go on my Pixel 7 Pro.

8. **Internet Connection**: Get a Ubigi e-sim plan for reliable 5G connectivity.

Hope these tips help anyone planning a trip to Japan with kids!

Safe travels! 🌸🗾🚆

For those from the states that have high sales tax, you def. can save on electronics in Japan just merely for the tax savings alone.

Shoes!  Never travel with a brand new set.  Buy them a month before you leave, and break them in before you go.  Good walking/running shoes go a long way, especially if you are averaging over 10KM a day.  
With jet lag, go to bed, even if it's early, right after sunset the first day.  set an alarm for the next morning just before sunrise.  Keep the curtains open so you will get the sunlight as much as possible.  
I have been doing that for a while, and it gets you over the worse of the lag usually in 2 days.

And, +1 on hotel breakfast buffets.  I have yet to have a bad breakfast in hotel in Japan, in over the 20 years of going there.

We've been to Japan twice with kids, first time aged 5 and 7 and most recently aged 9 and 11 (just got back two weeks ago and still miss the place!). They really enjoyed trotting down to 7-eleven each morning for breakfast and picking up their choice of onigiri, sweet bun and yoghurt drink. Sometimes we'd mix it up with fried chicken or cup noodles instead, or a full breakfast with (microwaved) grilled salmon on rice with a salad, all sourced from 7-eleven. It became such a morning ritual and one of the highlights of the trip!

Mine aren’t quite that young but I DEFINITELY agree with the hotel buffet if you got one. Suck it up and do it, everyone gets something they want (super convenient) and can go over the days plans. 

I would also add “Do not overschedule” which is just common sense with kids. It is tempting because you likely won’t be back any time soon, but the only time for me that things went really poorly was when we were trying to fit in one extra activity and everyone was tired.

Dealing with jet lag is the number one thing I tell people to worry about when traveling to Japan. It doesn't matter if you have kids. People give me plans (that always start with Tokyo) and say they want to do five things during the day and then go out in Shinjuku or Roppongi at night. I tell them to save Tokyo nightlife for the end of their trip if they can and to greatly reduce the amount of stuff they're cramming into the early trip. They never change their plans and then they actually deal with jetlag and all these plans go away.
