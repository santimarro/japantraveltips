# I consumed a tax free item in japan. How bad is it?

I bought some tax free matcha powder and matcha chocolate, opened the sealed bag in the dark, not seeing that it said not to, and ate the chocolate then and there. I wasn't aware of the tax free laws. Will I be able to pay the tax at the airport when leaving or can I expect worse consequences?

And now you’ve admitted it publicly. We’re headed to your room now, wanted to give you a running start. See you soon…

They don't care, it'll be fine I promise

I had my own thing where I bought some items tax free at Yodobashi. They put everything into a large, unwieldy bag I would not be able to pack easily. I ended up opening the bag, and in some cases, even taking things out of their boxes so I could pack them loose and save space. Nobody even looked at me sideways at the airport.
