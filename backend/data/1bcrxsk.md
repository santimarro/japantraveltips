# Women, what did you buy in Japan?

Currently here and want to pick some quality products. Whether it be skin care,snacks, clothing or tech! I did check a bag. Hobbies include working out, cooking, reading, & lounging on my days off. Love make up, clothes, and styling my hair! ( curly girl here) we are currently in Tokyo and leave in 2 days to Kyoto then Osaka! 

So far I’ve purchased 
Tiger Mexico 66 shoes
Matcha
Uniqlo basic tees
Some reading glasses 
Sunscreen, vitamin C, mascara, chapsticks, eye cream.

Apart from skin products and the minty eye drops, I got stationaries (particularly mechanical pencils and fountain pens)

If you are a, how do I say, a "girly girl", the stores in LaForet (Harajuku area) and Shibuya 109 (well, Shibuya area) are an absolute must. There's so much cute stuff, from handmade accessories to local brands with styles you typically won't get overseas.

The Biore aqua sunscreen is excellent, the best I've used so far. Cute high quality stationery, handmade chopsticks, beautiful hand thrown pottery, particularly a matcha bowl and chawan. We got lots of small dishes too which are very useful at home. Weirdly, their soft hair elastics are so much better, they last and last without snapping. 

I got a simple cross body bag from a department store which was so cheap but it is a wonderful thing; it's similar to those viral Uniqlo bags but bigger. Used it every day in Japan. 

Loft was one of my kids favourite stores and we spent a fortune, I got good scissors, a bag, little potplants to grow, all sorts of really good quality stuff. 

I don't wear makeup but I got some Allie colour-evening face sunscreen (I think from Don Quixote) and it's very good. 

Lots of tea! And matcha desserts and sweets, chocolates. I went to Uji mainly to stock up on teas.

Snacks. We say very often, why didn't we buy more?! You can find some great ones in the less upmarket shopping malls and areas, very cheap and very cute. 

Lots of small face cloths, so much variety.

Unexpectedly good,  but we got emergency socks, boxers and a cotton long sleeve top from Family Mart (I think? One of the conbinis) and they are genuinely excellent quality lol. They wash and wear so well, I'd thought they might be for the charity shop after the trip but no, they are great. 

Tabi socks, decent ones. And gashapon toys, some are just so cute to put on the shelf. 

If it's your thing, Switch games are cheaper there. Some lovely cotton and linen clothing. and just allllll the cute accessories, ugh I want to go back!

I'm obsessed with BaoBao bags...a store called SouSou in Kyoto and Tokyo. Beauty products by Sekkiesi at Donki (Blue bottle - mid range ¥) and Than beauty products (Thai but the best soaps). Also just Donki Mega store in Ginza! Shopping in the shimbashi in Osaka and The Namba walk... Tokyu Hands for cooking gadgets

You can buy nice accessories like umbrellas, wallets, washcloths, etc. at places like Tokyu Hands and LoFT. These stores also carry nice perfumes, haircare, skincare, and bath products.

Stores like Donki have some decent beauty products, but you'll find them cheaper at drug stores. When I've come to Japan I've brought back foundation compacts (very popular in Japan and make your skin look flawless), mascara, sparkly eyeshadow, etc.

If you like cooking, I recommend stopping by a local supermarket and stocking up on ingredients you can bring home. Last time I went to Japan I brought back some bottles of soy sauce, sukiyaki sauce, soup stock concentrate, teabags, etc. Houjicha is a really nice toasted green tea that is largely available in Japan but rarer overseas. Cooking mochi also has a long shelf life and can be added to hot pot and soups. 

As for clothes and accessories, stores like GU offer nice discounted streetwear at a cheaper price than their sister store, UNIQLO, and as far as I know they aren't overseas. MUJI has nice things too.

I usually bring home some pens, mechanical pencils, stationary, beads, sewing and crochet supplies, etc.

Can't go wrong with some cute gachapon keychains...

Honestly, ¥100 shops like Daiso offer a lot of stuff.
