# Day 1 done in Japan and already exhausted

Not here to rant! I am just physically exhausted and overwhelmed by Tokyo in the best way possible. Had heaps fun in Shibuya and Shinjuku but I‚Äôm thinking for day 2, I‚Äôll keep it more simple and stick to one district where I can still shop for mostly fashion/accessories, drink good coffee and eat somewhere cozy, and not feel like I‚Äôm missing out on greater Japan lol. Any recommendations on more chill places in Tokyo to do these things in?

UPDATE: went to Shimokitazawa after finding out it‚Äôs full of thrift stores and cafes which is exactly the kind of scene I was after. Today wasn‚Äôt even that busy so it definitely fit there more relaxed vibe I was after. Fell in love with the charm of this place and my favourite part was walking from Sasazuka station to Shimokitazawa and seeing all the beautiful streets full of cute houses and cool architecture. I‚Äôm so impressed with everything in this country!

If you need to have a break in the middle of your day, you can go to a electronics store like Bic or Yodabashi and "sample" their massage chairs.

First couple days are tough especially with the jet lag , time difference.... Take it easy!

Oka Cafe inside Showa Kinen Park is a absolutely stunning wooden structure (it was designed by leading Japanese architect Kengo Kuma) ü´∂üèø

We had the same after day 1. On day 2 we slept in a little, sought out a good bakery for a chill breakfast (we loved Higurashi Bakery which was close to our guesthouse) and spent some time roaming around Asakusa, which has the amazing temple, a lot of shopping and restaurants, Kappabashi street nearby and then Hoopy streets to get in some drinks and food towards the evening, strolling back to the temple for some night photos afterwards.

Might be a good option, never felt as overwhelming as Shibuya and the other districts of Tokyo.

I'd recommend Asakusa, the surrounding streets have some great food and drinks. The area is beautiful with a lot of history and some great views of Skytree.
