# Help: Just not ‘getting’ Tokyo…

TLDR: I’ve been in Japan a week and loving it. Osaka, Nara, Hiroshima = awesome. Tokyo = I’m hating it so far and have 4x more nights paid up here.  Now considering going back to Kyoto on the train for the stuff I missed, but will result in lots of back and forth as my flight is also out of Osaka.

I’ve been in Japan for a week and have absolutely LOVED it so far, and feels like I’ve been here ages and seen heaps! I arrived in Osaka, and did a day exploring there, before venturing out for day trips to Hiroshima, Nara, Kyoto and a day at Universal Studios. 

I arrived in Tokyo yesterday for the second half of my trip… and, I just don’t feel anywhere near the same as I have about everywhere else I’ve been… honestly it just isn’t doing it for me, at all. 

Not sure what I’m missing or doing wrong - today I followed heaps of the suggestions of this group and ticked off Shinjuku, Shibuya Crossing, Ahikabara and  Harajuku. And…. Meh. It all just feels a bit soulless and like a giant shopping mall. Osaka and Kyoto both had so much character in comparison, and I was able to walk home each night without having to fight off 20 people offering me ‘special massages’. 

Not sure what I’m doing wrong or missing, and unsure what to do with my remaining days as my hotel is all paid up (and annoyingly like triple the price of what I paid in Osaka!)

Get on the Inokashira Line and visit places in Western Tokyo like Kichioji and Shimokitazawa. These are more laid-back places.

It sounds more like you have no real purpose and are just roaming around Tokyo, whereas you probably had more pointed itineraries when you were in relatively small places like Hiroshima or Nara.

Tokyo has a lot of stuff, but without knowing what was particularly interesting to you up to this point, I don't know what you'd want to hear.

Like if you want shrines/temples, there are places like Asakusa and Meiji Jingu, but also many others like Zojoji.

There are many half-day or day trips you can take to places like Nikko, Kawaguchiko, Kawagoe, Kamakura, Yokohama.

I venture around the city hunting down coffee, and use that as an excuse to explore the city.

You don't have to be "missing" anything. You're not required to like every place you visit, and you don't need to somehow justify the fact that you don't like it. I don't love Tokyo, either. I'm an Osaka person, and when I visit Japan, I usually try to base myself out of Osaka unless there's a good reason not to. My other frequent "unpopular" opinion is that I don't like Kyoto. There are people who love it and can spend weeks there. Not me. We all like what we like.

I would take the advice of others in this thread who are giving you ideas on stuff to do in Tokyo, but I'm simply going to say to trust your gut and don't be upset with yourself just because you don't like something that other people like. Getting out of the city might help—Kamakura and Enoshima are nice, and Yokohama will have a more "Osaka-like" feel to it. You could consider more involved day trips, too, such as Nikko or Kawaguchiko. Some people like Kawagoe for it's more "historical" feeling (if you liked places like Nara and Kyoto).

Sounds like you are packing too much into your day to really do anything. Doing Shibuya, Harajuku, Akihabara, and Shinjuku in one day isn’t a good thing and basically means you spent half your day on trains. 

You should easily be able to milk multiple days out of each of these spots. At the bare minimum, a full 8 hour day in each. 

Kyoto is special in its own right, but Tokyo absolutely has a ton of magical areas that I feel are way better than Osaka. 

Maybe post some things you liked about the other areas you spent time in and enjoyed and I can throw some recommendations out!
