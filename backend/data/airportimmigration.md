Entering Japan as a tourist usually involves having one of two things: a visa or a visa waiver. Passport-holders of [over 60 countries](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/short/novisa.html) can enter Japan under a visa waiver, meaning that you are not required to get a visa before arriving in Japan or upon entry. You can simply fly to Japan, and you will receive a "Landing Permission" in your passport that allows you to engage in tourism activities for the duration of your stay.

Passport-holders of countries **not** on the list above will need to secure a visa before arriving in Japan. Visa applications and requirements for Short-Term Stays are listed [here](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html) on the official website. If you are not a passport-holder of a visa waiver country, you will **not be allowed into Japan without a visa**, so be sure to get your visa arranged ahead of time.

### Visit Japan Web / Fast-Track Entry into Japan

For passport-holders of visa waiver countries, you can now fill out Immigration, Customs, and COVID information ahead of time on the [Visit Japan Web](https://vjw-lp.digital.go.jp/en/) site. The site will ask for similar information to the paper Immigration and Customs forms, including information about you, your arriving flight, the length of time you're staying in Japan, and the address you are staying in Japan.

When you've completed the online process, you will receive QR codes for Immigration and Customs. These QR codes replace the paper forms, so if you have them, you do not need to fill out any paper forms on the plane or at the airport. You'll also receive a "review completed" blue screen for COVID. Optionally, you may also complete other portions of Visit Japan Web that might issue QR codes, such as the tax-free shopping portion.

### How does the immigration process work?

_This section assumes you are entering as a tourist on a [visa waiver](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/short/novisa.html). If you are from a country that does not have a visa waiver agreement with Japan, or you are not entering as a tourist, you must apply in advance for the appropriate visa (for tourists, Temporary Visitor) and this section does not apply to you. Please visit the [the official visa site](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html) for more information._

Most airlines will not permit individuals to fly to Japan unless passengers are in possession of either a return ticket or a ticket leaving Japan within the visa waiver time frame. Visa waivers on arrival are issued entirely at the discretion of immigration inspectors, so it is possible that these inspectors may also ask for documentation of a return/exiting flight upon arrival in Japan. It is prudent to have a return ticket booked, but it is not required.

Tourists who are citizens of countries entered into a visa waiver agreement with Japan only need to bring their passport to be admitted to Japan. You will also need to have either filled out all Immigration/Customs information online ahead of time at [Visit Japan Web](https://vjw-lp.digital.go.jp/en/), or you'll need to have filled out the paper forms provided on your plane or at the airport.

A facial photo and fingerprints of both your index fingers will be taken before your passport is stamped.

While there is no officially published policy or law regarding how long you can stay in Japan per year, too much time spent in the country can trigger scrutiny from immigration officials. While a few short trips in one year or a couple of longer ones won't be a problem, if Japanese Immigration starts believing you are attempting to live in the country rather than act as a tourist in it, they can question you or deny you entry. As such, [/r/JapanTravel](/r/JapanTravel) does not endorse "visa runs" or other methods of "living" in Japan rather than visiting it for vacation.

Yes. All tourists entering Japan will see an immigration officer upon arrival, and you will have a "Temporary Visitor" sticker put in your passport. This sticker is sometimes needed for tourist-only services and activities, such as getting a JR Pass or doing tax-free shopping.

The only people who don't get "Temporary Visitor" stickers in their passports are citizens/residents and people entering under the [Japan Trusted Traveler Program](https://www.ttp.moj.go.jp/TTP/xhtml/apply/top.xhtml), which is _not_ something you can be a part of without knowing (it requires interviews and documentation). Individuals holding TTP status/cards will have their Temporary Visitor status stamped on the back of their TTP card upon entry.

### How does the customs process work?

Customs is responsible for monitoring what goods are brought in and out of the country. Once you get off your plane and pass immigration, you will pick up your checked luggage (if you have any) and head to customs.

At customs, an officer may ask you some questions about your trip ("How long are you staying?", "Have you brought anything into the country?"), and they may want to open your bags for an inspection. For most travelers, customs is a very brief stop right before they exit the restricted area of the airport and are free to proceed to their destination.

### What can I bring or not bring to Japan?

Japanese Customs restricts several classes of items from entering the country. Other items, such as plants or animals, are subject to importation regulation. To prevent problems upon arrival in Japan, it is best to ensure you are not in possession of anything that is prohibited. controlled, or requires a quarantine procedure. [Please check this list provided by the Consulate-General of Japan in Seattle](https://www.seattle.us.emb-japan.go.jp/about/import_restrictions.html) to see what is specifically covered by these rules.

### Working in Japan Under a Tourist Visa or Waiver

Working in Japan while on a tourist visa or waiver is illegal — whether for financial gain, in exchange for college credit, in exchange for room and board or as a part of an internship program, or any other type of "payment". Any of the aforementioned scenarios instead require a work visa or permission to engage in activity other than that permitted waiver (only intended for students or dependents/spouses). (Short-term study at a Japanese language school within the length of your visa or visa waiver is permitted. However, any length of student longer than the term of your visa or waiver would require a student visa. You may not work as a short-term study student.)

Individuals entering Japan for the purpose of work or work training (i.e., internships) without the proper visa are subject to detention and/or deportation.

Additionally, companies who offer internships or job "training period" offers to foreigners without issuing the proper work visa often have reputations for being "black companies" — companies with poor or questionable business practices that operate outside the scope of Japanese labor laws.

Japanese labor laws are intended to protect workers. By not following the law and working under a tourist visa, you lose the many protections that the labor laws would provide in a traditional work visa situation.

Volunteering is a grey area that isn't clearly defined by these rules. However, it is always best to err on the side of caution and not engage in anything that would be considered job-like while in Japan as a tourist.
