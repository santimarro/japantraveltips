**IMPORTANT NOTE: This FAQ has been updated to reflect situation as of 1 October 2023.**

It is important to note that the **JR Pass** most travelers refer to is a **nation-wide pass**, meaning you can use it throughout the country — but there are also _regional or local alternatives_ that might be more attractive depending on your itinerary. For more information, see below.

The Basics
----------

### What Is the JR Pass?

The **[Japan Rail Pass](https://japanrailpass.net/en/)** (commonly referred to as the JR Pass) is a cost-effective rail pass for long-distance train travel in Japan. The JR Pass offers unlimited use of JR trains throughout Japan for one, two, or three weeks at a highly reduced rate compared to the full-fare cost of most high-speed rail tickets. [Japan Guide has a great overview of the JR Pass](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2361.html) if you'd like to read more.

### Am I Eligible to Use a JR Pass?

The JR Pass is **only** available to foreign tourists and Japanese citizens who have resided outside of Japan in one country for 10 years or more. Foreigners residing in Japan under student visas, work visas, spouse/dependent visas, Working Holiday visas, SOFA, or any other resident status are ineligible to purchase the JR Pass. Foreigners must be in Japan under a tourist visa or waiver to exchange and use the JR Pass, and they must have a "Temporary Visitor" sticker in their passport. Please read the [official JR Pass eligibility requirements](https://japanrailpass.net/about_jrp.html) for more specific information.

Note that JR East's Tohoku Area Pass, Nagano-Niigata Area Pass and Tokyo Wide Pass are available to all non-Japanese passport holders, while most other regional passes are only available to visitors with a "Temporary Visitor" sticker.

### How Can I Get a JR Pass?

You can get a JR Pass via the following methods:

Please note that information on your JR Pass order or JR Pass exchange voucher **must exactly match** to the data in your passport, so be sure to enter your name correctly when making the purchase.

Japanese passport holders that are eligible for JR Pass are eligible only for exchange vouchers purchased from authorized travel agencies at their place of business (physical location).

There is no price difference between buying from official JR site and authorized retailer and you have to pick up your JR Pass (if you bought directly from JR) or exchange the voucher at at one of the appropriate [JR offices/ticket windows](https://japanrailpass.net/en/exchange.html). You need to have a physical pass for use within the country. There is no digital version.

Buying from official site requires you to set up activation day within 30 days of purchase, but comes with ability to book reserved seats on the trains from the moment of the purchase.

Buying from third-party vendor will result in you getting a voucher (exchange order), which must be exchanged within 90 days of purchase. The date of activation can be set within 30 days from the moment of the exchange.

### When Should I Buy My JR Pass?

If you buy your pass from an authorized retailer, please allow 2-4 weeks for shipping. Otherwise, you should use the [JR online retail site](https://www.japanrailpass-reservation.net/) if you require for the pass to be available immediately. If you buy from the official website, you get an email confirmation and can use that to pick up your JR Pass.

### What Trains are the JR Pass Valid for?

The Japan Rail Pass is valid on:

*   **JR trains**: The pass is valid on almost all trains operated on the nationwide Japan Railways (JR) network, including shinkansen (high speed), N'EX (Narita Express), limited express, express, rapid and local trains. Trains that are not operated by Japan Railways (ie: Tokyo Subway, Keio Line, Odakyu Line) are not covered by this pass.
*   **Tokyo Monorail** to/from Haneda Airport.
*   **JR Ferry** to Miyajima.
*   **Non-JR trains with access isolated JR lines**: A small number of non-JR trains provide access remote, isolated JR lines that would otherwise be inaccessible by using the JR pass alone. Pass holders may, however, only get on and off at stations that provide a transfer to JR lines. These lines include: Aoimori Railway between Aomori, Noheji and Hachinohe to access the JR Ominato Line to the Shimokita Peninsula; IR Ishikawa Railway between Kanazawa and Tsubata to access the JR Nanao Line to the Noto Peninsula; Ainokaze Toyama Railway between Toyama and Takaoka to access the JR Himi Line and JR Johana Line.
*   **Local JR buses**: The pass is valid on local buses operated by JR (but not on highway buses). There are not many of these buses, but the following services can be useful to foreign tourists: Yamaguchi - Hagi; Kyoto Station - Ryoanji - Takao; Kanazawa Station - Kenrokuen; JR buses to Lake Towada; JR tourist loop bus in Hiroshima; JR city buses around Sapporo; JR local bus to Kusatsu Onsen; BRT services on Sanriku Coast.

### Restrictions of JR Pass validity

The Japan Rail Pass **is absolutely not valid** on:

*   **Nozomi** and **Mizuho** shinkansen without a special surcharge.
*   certain non-regular joyful and luxury trains

The Japan Rail Pass **requires additional base, limited express charges or surcharges** on the following services:

*   Fuji excursion services and JR Chuo line through-services between Otsuki and Kawaguchiko;
*   Hashidate / Tango relay services (Fukuchiyama-Miyazu, Miyazu-Nishi-Maizuru, Miyazu-Toyooka).
*   Mt. Fuji services between Shinjuku and Matsuda;
*   Nanki / Mie services between Kawarada and Tsu;
*   Odoriko and JR Ito line services between Ito and Izukyu-Shimoda;
*   Shimanto / Ashizuri services between Kubokawa and Sukumo, including JR Yodo line through-service between Wakai and Kubokawa;
*   Shirayuki services between Naoetsu, Joetsumyoko and Arai;
*   Spacia, Spacia Kinugawa and Kinugawa services between Kurihasi and Tobu-Nikko/Kinugawa Onsen;
*   Super Hakuto and Super Inaba services between Kamigori and Chizu;
*   Super Odoriko services between Mishima and Shuzenji.

The surcharges on non-JR portions of the trip will be collected in cash on board of respective trains or as an adjustment fare at the station of your destination.

The JR Pass is also valid only on JR line portion of the following through-services:

Kanto area:

*   JR Chuo/Sobu line through-services to Tokyo Metro Tozai Line (valid for Mitaka-Nagano and Nishi-Funabashi-Tsudanuma);
*   JR Joban line through-services to Tokyo Metro Chiyoda Line (valid for Kashiwa/Abiko/Toride-Ayase);

Kyushu area:

*   JR Chikuhi/Karatsu through-services to Fukuoka Subway Kuko line (valid for Nishi-Karatsu-Meinohama).

Tohoku area:

*   JR Hanawa line through-services to Iwate Galaxy Railway (valid for Odate-Koma);
*   JR Tohoku line through-services to Iwate Galaxy Railway (valid for Kitakami-Morioka)
*   JR Tohoku line through-service to Sendai Airport (valid for Natori-Sendai Airport)

Please note that using a combination of JR Pass and IC card will result in the need of manual adjustment of the fare on IC card by a station attendant.

### _Nozomi_ and _Mizuho_ upgrade tickets

JR Pass may be upgraded to allow use of _Nozomi_ and _Mizuho_ trains (known as NOZOMI MIZUHO ticket)

A green car JR Pass may be upgraded for a reserved seat in a green car, reserved seat in an ordinary car (excluding car 7 business services) and a non-reserved car.

An ordinary car may be upgraded for a reserved seat in an ordinary car (excluding car 7 business services) and a non-reserved car.

Note that there is limited of upgrade tickets available and they might not be available even if there are open seats on specific _Nozomi_ or _Mizuho_ trains.

[List of prices for all sections of NOZOMI MIZUHO ticket](https://japanrailpass.net/assets/pdf/special-ticket/en/price_for_all_sections.pdf).

Please note that when riding Nozomi or Mizuho train without a proper ticket, you would be expect to pay the full ticket price on the spot in cash.

### Reserved-Only train

Please note that some of JR shinkansen trains (Hayabusa/Komachi, Hayate, Tsubasa, Kagayaki) and multiple limited expresses (eg. Resort Shirakami, Yufuin-no-Mori, Hamakaze, Odoriko, Narita Express, Super Inaba) are reserved seats only.

### What Are the Exact Days My JR Pass is Valid for?

The validity period of the JR Pass is based on calendar days (midnight to midnight) rather than 24 hour periods. For example, when starting to use a 7-day pass at noon on Day 1, it will expire at midnight at the end of Day 7 rather than at noon of Day 8.

If you happen to be on a train when the JR Pass expires, you can complete that journey without issue, but you cannot start a new train journey.

### Can I Get a Refund on My JR Pass?

You can generally only get a refund on _unused_, _unexchanged_ JR Pass exchange vouchers, usually less some sort of processing fee. Please check with your individual JR Pass vendor for details. The JR Pass exchange voucher can usually be refunded within 12 months of the purchase date.

### Can I Get My JR Pass Re-Issued

You can only get JR Pass re-issued if it gets damaged or stops working at the gates (at the same travel centers that can be used to exchange the voucher). In order to do that, you _must_ still be in possession of the physical JR Pass.

You will not be re-issued a JR Pass that got lost, stolen, or eaten by a deer. This is because there is no proof that you didn't simply hand your JR Pass off to someone else to use, and you will be using a re-issued one.

If your pass gets "eaten" by a gate, contact the nearest attendant to open a gate and retrieve your pass. Do this immediately, before leaving the area.

Should I Buy a JR pass?
-----------------------

### Is the JR Pass Worth It for My Itinerary?

Following the price adjustment, a 7-day or 14-day JR Pass is unlikely to be of much use to an average tourist. If you are planning an open jaw trip with a rapid long-distance movement phase or visiting multiple areas in different regions, you might consider checking their viability. 21-day JR Pass still holds certain value for people who want to visit multiple regions of Japan.

Please note that most Golden Route (Tokyo-Kyoto-Osaka-Hiroshima) as well as New Golden Route (Kyoto-Kanazawa-Takayama-Tokyo) itineraries will not make a JR Pass worth the money.

A good first step is to try your itinerary out with one of these JR Pass calculators:

*   [JRPass.com’s calculator](https://www.jrpass.com/farecalculator)
*   [Japan Guide’s calculator](https://www.japan-guide.com/railpass/)
*   [Daisuki calculator](https://www.daisuki.com.br/jrpass_calculator.html)

With that estimate in hands, you can compare the prices of every trip and check what can and cannot be used with the JR Pass.

For a manual method to check if the JR Pass is right you, the following step-by-step guide can help you decide, but ultimately its worth/value is up to you, since there can be non-monetary reasons for choosing a JR passes or not (see next section).

1.  Start a spreadsheet or other document for recording prices. It'll be easier to tally things up and make modifications later.
2.  Figure out your travel dates and length of stay in each city. Most of the worth of passes are in travel between cities, not in local metro lines.
3.  Plug in your Shinkansen (bullet train) trips into [Jorudan](https://world.jorudan.co.jp/mln/en/japan-rail-pass/). Make sure you are using correct station names (e.g.: Shin-Osaka is where the Shinkansen goes through, not Osaka Station) -- station names at origin and destination points and not general city or area names are required.
4.  This should give you a rough estimate of how much each trip should cost.
5.  [Compare it to the current rates for the JR-Pass](https://japanrailpass.net/en/about_jrp.html#anchor03) or the regional passes.

**Some rules of thumb to keep in mind:**

*   The JR Pass is _not always a good deal_ (see next point). If you do out all the math and it's not worthwhile for you, that is completely normal.
*   The JR Pass always _requires_ long-distance shinkansen travel to make it a worthwhile purchase.
*   The JR Pass is never a good deal if you're only going one way — for example, flying into Tokyo, taking the Shinkansen to Osaka, then flying out of Osaka.

### I only want to use the JR Pass within a single city for local or semi-local train rides. Will it be worth it?

Short answer: **Absolutely not.**

### The JR Pass is only barely worth it for my trip. Should I get it anyway for convenience?

Some people do out all the math and find the JR Pass _doesn't quite_ become worthwhile for them, or only barely breaks even cost-wise. In those cases, it can be a matter of personal preference whether to get a JR Pass or not.

Some pros of the JR Pass (aside from cost savings):

*   You can usually avoid the time and effort of buying individual train tickets (through the use of non-reserved seating cars).
*   You can have flexibility in timing/scheduling because you don't need to buy tickets for a specific train.
*   You can go in and out of JR ticket gates as many times as needed without paying. (This can be handy for accessing things inside payment gates, like luggage lockers or shops.)

Some cons of the JR Pass:

*   You will have to wait in line to exchange your voucher or pick up your JR Pass at some point during your trip.
*   You will need to carry it in addition to an IC card, as the JR Pass will usually not cover all train travel you plan to do.
*   If you lose your JR Pass, you are out of luck, as you have just effectively lost _all_ your train travel tickets. JR Passes cannot be replaced.
*   You lose a good amount of flexibility of travel on Tokaido/Sanyo shinkansen, as well as some time, as you cannot take the fastest and most frequent trains on those routes.
*   If you were planning to reserve seats anyhow, you don't save any additional time or effort in having a JR Pass.

### The JR Pass is only barely worth it for my trip, or my travel is estimated as several thousand yen or more under the pass's cost. Can I make up the difference with local, intracity travel on JR lines?

That depends. Remember that most local train trips cost 160 - 440 yen, and you probably won't be making that many of them per day. Also keep in mind that certain cities don't have many or any JR lines. In Tokyo, the JR Pass can be quite useful for using the Yamanote line and the Chuo line to get around to popular tourist locations. In Kyoto, people find the JR Pass less useful for local train travel.

In general, it's not advisable to bank on making up large discrepancies with local travel. That said, it varies a lot based on your particular itinerary and travel style. If you will be hopping on and off JR trains multiple times a day in a city, you will have a better chance of making up the cost. If you are in a city with not a lot of JR coverage or you don't plan on using JR trains a lot, making up the cost will be much harder. Also don't forget to factor in travel between cities in airports — in some cities, that is covered by the JR Pass and can cost a non-trivial amount of money.

Choosing a JR Pass
------------------

### What is the difference between the JR Pass Ordinary and the JR Pass Green?

The differences between Green JR Passes and Ordinary JR Passes can be compared to the difference between economy and premium economy on a large commercial airline. Most passengers will find that the "ordinary" cars on Shinkansen trains are already quite comfortable and contain a nice variety of amenities. For this reason, a majority of travelers to Japan will find that the Green JR Pass is an unnecessary added expense for their trip. Due to the price difference, Green cars are usually less crowded and easier to reserve in short notice.

**Ordinary Car Features**

*   2-3 seat configuration (though some Kodama and Sakura train lines feature 2-2 seat configurations in ordinary cars)
*   Seat size 430mm width
*   Increased seat pitch/legroom 980mm
*   Seat recline 15°
*   One AC outlet per row (on wall)1
*   Tray capable of holding 5kg of weight
*   180° rotating seats (for groups of 3-4 traveling together to face one another)
*   Overhead racks for luggage or personal items
*   Luggage storage for 6-8 large bags at the front and rear of cars

[Here](https://imgcp.aacdn.jp/img-a/1200/auto/global-aaj-front/article/2017/04/58ed8d8144911_58ed7f3ac9981_1263240948.jpg) is an example of a regular train car on the Tokaido Shinkansen.

**Green Car Features**

Green Cars include all features of the Ordinary cars with some additions or upgrades, including:

*   2-2 seat configuration
*   Increased seat size (465mm-475mm width)
*   Increased seat pitch/legroom (1040mm-1160mm)
*   Increased seat recline (40°)
*   Adjustable foot rest
*   All seats are aligned with windows
*   One AC outlet per seat (under armrest)
*   Two fold-out trays
*   Seat-mounted light switch
*   3.5mm radio jack (not available on all lines)
*   Increased crew service (beverage and snack sales)
*   Premium floor and seat coverings
*   Free snack and drink on selected JR Hokkaido lines

Note 1: Additional outlets are added during modernization process of N700/N700S series trains.

### Are there other options than the expensive, national JR Pass? What about the regional passes I hear about? Would they work better for me?

Each pass other than the main national JR-Pass covers a specific _region_, and any trip leaving that region are not covered. These passes are good if you are planning most of your trip inside such an area. For instance, if you are only staying around Tokyo or Hakodate, consider one of the JR East passes. If you are staying around Osaka to Fukuoka, a JR West pass could work. If you plan on traveling between Tokyo and Kyoto, then it might be better check the JR Pass.

Remember: [calculating all trips and checking against what each pass cover](https://www.jrpass.com/farecalculator) will always be the most accurate way. All these tips and resources are a _good start_, but ultimately you must be sure by your own.

**Note:** There is **no regional pass which covers the Tokaido Shinkansen**. This is one of the most popular routes for tourists as it is between Tokyo/Kyoto/Osaka. If you are taking this route, you will need a full-coverage national JR Pass.

Using a JR Pass
---------------

It's important to note that you didn't buy a _JR Pass_, you bought an _exchange voucher for a JR Pass_. You'll need to take this voucher with you to Japan and exchange it at a JR Office. [Here](http://www.japanrailpass.net/en/exchange.html) is a list of exchange offices; almost all major airports and cities have exchange offices. Many people opt to get their JR Pass immediately at the airport in order to use it to get from the airport into the city (many cities, including Tokyo, have JR trains from the airport). This is not necessary, though. You can exchange for your pass at any point in your trip that makes sense, and sometimes the lines at the airport locations make it advantageous to exchange the pass elsewhere.

### Do I need to activate my JR Pass on the day I exchange my voucher?

No. You can exchange the voucher and set the start date of the JR Pass for any date you want within a 30 day period. So if you arrive to Japan on a Sunday, but don't want to use your JR Pass until Thursday, you can exchange for the JR Pass any time between Sunday and Thursday and have the JR Pass set to activate on Thursday.

### How do I physically use the JR Pass?

You can currently use JR Pass with the automated gates of JR stations by inserting the JR Pass into the gate as you would with a normal ticket. If an automated gate is not available, walk through a manned ticket gate and display your pass.

Don't forget you to take the JR Pass with you when you cross the gate.

### When can I start to reserve tickets with my JR Pass?

If you purchased your JR Pass from the official website, you can use the website interface to make reservations up to 30 days in advance. If you are exchanging a voucher in Japan or plan to buy the pass in Japan, reservations cannot be made until you have your JR Pass in hand.

Furthermore, you can only make seat reservations for the validity of your pass. For example, if you have ordered a 7 day pass and you exchange your voucher into a JR Pass on the 5th of the month for it to begin on the 10th, you can only make seat reservations for departures within the period of the 10th to the 16th of the month. You will not be able to reserve seats for journeys that start before the pass has begun or after the pass has finished.

### Do I always need to reserve seats with the JR Pass? What is this I hear about "reserved cars" and "non-reserved cars"?

Many JR trains are local or rapid trains with no reserved seating at all. They are a lot like rapid metropolitan transportation/subway transportation anywhere around the world.

Reserved seating comes into play with limited express/shinkansen trains. Shinkansen trains comes in two flavors:

*   All reserved seating, which means every single seat on the train is assigned to a particular person, and you will require seat reservations to travel.
*   Mixed cars between reserved seating and non-reserved seating, which means some train cars are "all reserved" and some cars are "non-reserved". Non-reserved cars will be indicated on signage both inside and outside the train.

It is _always_ possible to reserve a seat on a shinkansen train. If you want to assure yourself a seat on a particular shinkansen train, you can take your JR Pass to a JR Office and reserve a seat on the train of your choice for free.

If the shinkansen you are riding has non-reserved seating available, you can also opt to forgo a seat reservation. Instead, you can just take any free seat in a non-reserved train car. Many people find this convenient because it requires no prior planning and no extra interaction with JR Office staff — you can just walk right down to the platform at whatever time works best for you and get on the train. At busy times, though, non-reserved cars can fill up so you run risk of not getting very good seating options and the slight risk that the train you want might be full and you'll have to wait for the next one. If you arrive on the platform and their are lines for non-reserved cars, it is common courtesy to stand in line like everyone else.

Route Planning
--------------

### Can I get by with only using a JR Pass for my entire trip?

The short answer is: probably not, but possibly. The JR Pass is mostly useful and valuable for long-distance travel on expensive shinkansen trains. There are some cities like Tokyo and Osaka where you can get a lot of local, intra-city use out of the JR Pass, but it is unlikely you will be able to get _everywhere_ you want to go with just a JR Pass. Many people choose to have an IC Card (see below) in addition to a JR Pass.

### What is an IC Card and what does it have to do with a JR Pass?

An [IC Card](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2359_003.html) is a prepaid, rechargeable card that is used to pay for subway and train rides, similar to a ClipperCard (San Francisco), MetroCard (NYC), CharlieCard (Boston), OysterCard (London), or OctopusCard (Hong Kong). IC Cards are convenient because you can use them to swipe in and out of subway gates without needing to buy an individual ticket for each ride. They can also be used to purchase goods at vending machines and convenience stores.

IC Cards are completely separate from JR Passes, but many people choose to have both a JR Pass _and_ an IC Card, since the IC Card can be used on train systems where the JR Pass isn't valid (any non-JR train system). There are no benefits to having an IC Card for transit beyond the convenience of swiping in and out of subway gates easily.
