# Advice for beating jet lag on day 1 in Tokyo?

Hi! My partner and I will be landing in Haneda airport at 5am on day 1 of our Japan trip. I understand that going through customs, transferring luggage, train passes etc will take quite a bit of time, but even assuming we are in Tokyo by noon, hotels don’t let you check in until 3 or 4, correct? Where can we nap or re-charge when we first land? I think if we nap in the afternoon, we can make it through the evening and then be on Japan time for the rest of our trip. Please let me know if anyone has some pro tips to beat that jet lag. Thanks in advance!

Sleep on the plane if you can. If you're like me though, thats not an option.

Failing plane sleep, my advise is 'tough it out'. Don't nap, don't go to bed early, tough it out until 9-10pm. Yes, your first afternoon will be a bit muted but if you manage this you should be alright for the rest of the trip.

Lmfao, If you land at 5am you will be getting your luggage and through customs by the latest 6. Even after taking the metro into downtown it would be 8. Japanese efficiency is second to none.

It’s best to sleep in the plane and be up before you land as you’re reaching in the morning. If you’re landing at 5am you’ll be in Tokyo easily by 7am, you can drop your luggage at the hotel grab some breakfast and head out to explore, you can checkin by 3pm and rest for the day sleep early and adjust to Japan timezone. Like this you won’t be wasting a day and won’t be jet lagged as well.

I mean, you could find a love hotel (*rabuho*) or capsule hotel near where you're staying and nap for a couple hours, but I agree with the comments of what others have said - if it were me, I'd try and fight my way through the tired on day one and have a massive sleep on night one.

Customs and immigration will take no time if you've done the Visit Japan Web app and have your QR codes, waiting for your luggage on the carousel will take longer. My guess is you're out of all that by 6am.

Read up, there are plenty of places at Haneda for sleeping, showering, storage lockers, etc. You probably need 1-4 hours rest.

You can also use a jet lag calculator to preset yourself to Japan time before you leave on your trip.

Probably easier to get an esim set up airalo (there was a deal on 10GB last month) or ubigi and then when you get off the plane you've internet right away. Or whatever you've got setup.

Luggage forwarding, is open either early or 24.hours. Your end hotel should be okay receiving your luggage before you get there as long as your name is the same as on your reservation. You can't typically send to a AirBNB, but you could send to a service centre near your hotel for the company you ship with.
