# Looking to travel to Japan solo

I will preface this by saying I'm in my early 20's and have never traveled anywhere by myself, besides to a few states away and back. 

I really want to go to Japan, but all of my friends either can't afford it or aren't interested. I've been looking into guided tour groups (TruTravels etc) because my parents would worry a ton if I went totally alone, and I'm also extremely overwhelmed. However, a lot of these groups seem a bit expensive. I'm hoping to spend under $5,000 USD. I'm hoping some of you have some recommendations for travel groups, or some advice. I want to go to Japan next year no matter what!

Hey! Just go alone, you'll have a great time.

I went a few times for work and scheduled some time off to go sightseeing by myself, had a blast exploring Tokyo and the surrounding cities.

Other times I would do day trips to other regions.

Japan is extremely safe so your parents shouldn't worry.

Go for it!!!

It’s absolutely fine to travel to Japan solo. 

I don’t think there’s any need to join a tour group and perhaps the only reason to join a tour would be to have some company. 

Japan is a very easy country to travel around and with modern technology such as smartphones, with translation apps and transport info, it’s much, much easier to get around than it used to be. 

I think your main challenge will be deciding where you want to go and what you want to do.

japan is the only country i been to where it is normal socially to eat alone. They have solo bbq restaurants where you just grill your own food. solo ramen restaurants, solo sushi restaurants like uobei. You can even stay cheap at solo capsule hotel which goes from $15 to $45 a night. Honestly I would love to go to japan solo again. Unfortunately my fam has caught on that i go to japan often and they want to tag along. :(

Japan is very likely to be safer than whatever place you are from. It’s definitely doable to travel solo, you can go wherever you want and not be tied to the guided tour group. Just make sure you bring along google translate and some common sense.

Japan solo is perfectly fine. Probably the cheapest way to travel is to stay in hostels or capsule hotels, and I found if you select certain ones you can find friends to hang out with all day, or be left alone... your choice.
