# What are the lesser known things to buy when in Japan?

I've been reading around what to buy in Japan and a lot of sites recommend skincare, tea and candy items, as well as clothes to buy cheaper due to exchange rates. One of my friends reccomended to me to look into getting a sukajan, although I haven't seen that recommended anywhere in relation to Japanese souvenirs. I also was thinking of going to a kintsugi class and taking home the ceramic as a souvenir. What else is lesser known but good to buy from Japan?

Personally, I'm on the lookout for a good umbrella.

I love the style and aesthetics of Japanese ceramics and picked up a bunch of small bowls and plates near the end of my trip. I bought 4 ramen bowls that would have cost at least 2-3 times more in my home country.


Best to have the ceramics packed in your carry on bag wrapped in some clothes otherwise it'll be thrown all about in/out of the checked baggage compartment.

GLASSES! I got a pair of glasses for like 6500 yen (50 USD!), lens and frame included, and they delivered it to my hotel because I was changing city. You can take a prescription from home or take a free test there that uses symbols instead of letters. I went to JINS but Zoff is also inexpensive. And it was tax free.

EDIT: Found my bill from J!NS and the glasses were only 6000 yen. Shipping to my hotel was 600 yen. They said it would take a week, but they arrived in like 5 days. I went to the store on Saturday, and when  I arrived at my next hotel in Tokyo on Wednesday they were already waiting for me. 

I also got nice business suit pants from AOKI (the one in Akihabara has lots of foreign tourists so they have sizes that fit). They have a built-in size adjustment system at the belt and are super light. With the tailoring of the leg length it cost me like... 90 CAD tax free (65 USD).

Washi tape if you’re into crafts/journaling. Same with stationary/pens. Cheap, light, easy to pack and make great gifts. 

Hand towels. You’ll want at least one to use while you’re there, but we brought back lots for gifts and more of the larger tea towel size ones to use in our kitchen. You can find some really unique and well made ones as well as location specific ones at popular sights. 

Watches. My husband got a very limited Seiko that he was thrilled to find. Seems like the used watch market is strong in addition to the large Seiko stores. 

We bought some unique clothing both new and secondhand. 

Would absolutely recommend ceramics. Every store wrapped them really thoroughly for us and we packed them well in carry ons. We got several different bowls and a few sake sets and cups. We love having these pieces to use everyday.
