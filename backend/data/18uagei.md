# Exiting a shinkansen and boarding a local train, what did I do wrong?

So i reserved tickets for a shinkansen from Nagano to Tokyo station, put in my pair of tickets in the machine at Nagano, disembarked at Tokyo and exited by putting in both tickets again, which gave me one back.

Then we needed to hop on another line, but as boarded the train, i realized we never tapped our Suica card anywhere. When we got off, i tapped the Suica card and sure enough it denied me exit. I explained what happened to the guy at the gate, he asked for my shinkansen ticket and let me go.

What was I supposed to do instead? I'm not quite sure where it went wrong. I'm glad it worked out in the end but I just feel confused and don't want it to happen again.

For Nagato to Tokyo, you basic fare ticket will be valid to any stations in Tokyo 23 wards (which is why the transfer gate return your ticket). You use that ticket to exit at any valid stations.

### Comment 2

You use your shinkansen ticket that you have left. That tickets usually allow you to exit anywhere in the 23 wards. If you have never touched on with your suica, don't touch off. 

Residents usually register their suica and tie their shinkansen tickets to them to avoid this confusion. We don't use paper shinkansen tickets unless it's from a pass.

I had something similar in reverse - you need to tap your suica before using the Shinkansen ticket.

This was to get ON the train at Tokyo after we had taken the Yamanote line to get to Tokyo station.

(Edit to add that we were not the only ones doing it wrong and the guard at the gate had to explain it to every group of travellers with bad sign language - it was actually one of my kids who said out loud you need to do it in a specific order and then we all could go through - ours and a few others who were stuck at the gates)

Don't feel bad. It happens all the time, even to locals. It's like a right of passage!

### Comment 5

The fact that Shinkansen often requires two paper tickets to be inserted at the same time baffles me when everything else runs on Suica and other IC cards. Are there digital Shinkansen tickets?
