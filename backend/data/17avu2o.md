# Does anyone prefer visiting Japan in the winter months?

I know many to prefer to visit in the spring or fall, but I’m looking at November, December and January months. But as I’m coming from Canada, the average temps of  5-10 degree Celsius temps are comparatively mild. I think outdoor winter onsens would also be great to experience.

As this would be considered low season, I would hope hotel prices are much cheaper. 
But are there main tourist attractions (mostly in Tokyo and Kyoto) that are not open during the winter?

The big tourist attractions are pretty well open year-round. New Year is the only exception - you'd have to check as it's one of the biggest national holidays in Japan. Even the days around New Year, a lot of the medium and small businesses will be closed, as many people travel to see family.

Otherwise, the weather is actually pretty decent, assuming you stay in or south of the Kanto area. I'm also Canadian and enjoy Japan in the winter. The only thing is that a lot of buildings in Japan just don't have adequate heating or insulation (hotels and businesses, in general, do, though), so depending on where you're staying/hanging out, sometimes it feels like you just can't escape the cold (even if the temperatures are mild compared to Canada). Still, if I had to choose between summer or winter in Japan, it would 1000% be winter.

I LOVED visiting Japan in December and next time I'm going back will be in February. Most things were open, especially in Tokyo and Kyoto. I really loved cycling in the cold in Kawaguchiko and waking up early with temperatures around freezing point to get some sunrise shots of Fuji-san. It just felt so crips!! 

Although I'm assuming there were less tourists than in autumn or spring, there was still a significant amount of Chinese tourists everywhere though, especially Kyoto. 

The only thing that was under construction was the big Tori gate in Miyajima which was a bit of a bummer.

  
For this trip, we're planning to visit Hokkaido to see the snow/ice festival and enjoy some winter wonderland and am greatly looking forward to it

I visited Japan in February for the first time this year and it was the best decision I made. 

It was a week after Chinese New Year too. So everyone back home had to return to work while I flew off for my holiday lol. 

February was apparently a low season for tourism, so going to USJ was great. There were queues but I got through almost all the rides within minutes via the single rider line. 

Sadly I was too early for plum blossoms but I saw some really gorgeous blooms at the Kitano Tenmangu Shrine in Kyoto.

I travel light, but it helps that you are mostly wearing at least one set of pants and your jacket all the time anyway.

I just went to Japan for the first time in Sept and it wasn't quite as fun as Dec or March, but still amazing of course. I appreciated a little colder weather for when I was hitting 25-30k steps per day. The sweat in Sept is real.

Plus, December had really cool christmas lights and decorations everywhere, really cool to see in various train stations as we went city to city.

And finally, when it was hot I had almost zero appetite! If you are going specifically to eat all the amazing food, highly consider this... I didn't eat nearly as much variety when I was there in sept because I just wanted a drink when it was hot. I know I could have pigged out more in the colder months.

I've only gone twice (mid to late Jan first time prepandemic, and late Nov to early Dec last year) but November seems like the perfect month for traveling there. I'm from Wisconsin USA so it was definitely warmer than back home both times.  November had beautiful fall colors when we did garden and shrine tours. In January the trees were bare, so as far as the scenery it wasn't as lush obviously, but overall still was nice.  That said some of the gardens and outdoor activities may have reduced hours or be closed during winter time, so you may want to keep an eye on that.
