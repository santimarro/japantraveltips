# Is Japan in July as miserable as everyone seems to claim?

My family is currently planning our summer 2025 trip, and we're eyeing Japan (or possibly Vietnam or somewhere else in Asia). However, I seem to find lots of people online claiming visiting Japan in the summer is miserably hot and humid and they'd rather get a root canal without anesthesia than visit during that time.  
  
But according to Dr. Google, the average daily high temps (I think this might have specifically been for Tokyo?) are around 28-30C with humidity around 75%. We live in New York and that's basically identical to our summer weather, and I have no problem handling it. Yeah you need sunscreen and extra water, but it's nothing miserable or that would stop me from visiting. I'm originally from the southern US where summer daytime highs are more like 34C with 85% humidity.  
  
So are these people saying it's so hot it isn't even worth visiting perhaps from much cooler climates and just can't handle a heat that they're not used to? Or is it really that bad and it's a case of the numbers not really matching up to reality? Are there areas of Japan that are cooler and more bearable in the summer months? We already live in New York City, so we're happy to see smaller out of the way places versus big mega cities.

Edit: regarding our timing, my wife is a teacher, so if we come during winter or spring break, we can only stay a week. For as long and expensive as the flights are, we'd like to stay at least two weeks, which means it'll have to be over summer break (anytime from early July to late August). We also largely like to do outdoor activities with a heavy emphasis on hiking...

Itâ€™s just hot. Very hot and humid. Even Floridians are ill prepared for the kind of just sticky disgusting humidity that is Japan. The numbers are incredibly deceiving, the temperatures/humidity numbers 'look' similar. But they absolutely do not FEEL similar.

A few tips to deal with the heat, humidity and rain.

1) make sure you have a water bottle as part of your every day carry. Whether itâ€™s just reusing something you get at the grocery store, or you have your own canteen. 

2) get a handkerchief. This is extremely useful for wiping off the Niagara Falls worth of sweat. Plus itâ€™s useful for drying hands in the washrooms that donâ€™t have hand towels or dryers which is a non-zero number especially in temples

3) get a hat. The sun beating down on you will be pretty brutal

4) get an umbrella. Because youâ€™re in for a treat as rain is fairly common that time of year. Itâ€™s also fun when it stops raining, and the sun comes out. If you thought 100% was bad, Asia somehow made it worse

I've been to NYC in the summer more than a dozen times and Japan is a million times worse. Vietnam is actually worse than Japan in July too. In general, avoid East/Southeast Asia in the summer. It's just too hot and humid.

I donâ€™t know what you read, but thatâ€™s definitely low for Julyâ€¦ high temps between 34-37 are common in Tokyo. See: https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/japan/tokyo/historic?month=7&year=2023

As someone from Florida, Iâ€™m very used to high heat and humidity, and I do feel like it is a bit more intense in Tokyo. The humidity is BAD, and the heat is really stifling. I think in Japan Iâ€™m also outside more than I was in Florida, with walking between public transport stops and that sort of thingâ€¦ and not all places are effectively air conditioned either. In Florida I would go from ACâ€™d house to my ACâ€™d car and walk through a parking lot into an ACâ€™d store ðŸ˜†

If you do come in the hot months, I recommend a parasol, a cool towel (theyâ€™re easy to find in the summer, you wet it and wear around your neck), portable fan, and lots of hydration. People are vulnerable to heatstroke here. If you have young kids, be extra extra cautious, hydrate, and take breaks in the shade. It really is a serious health risk for the kids! 

I can tolerate it but itâ€™s definitely not pleasant ðŸ˜† but at least the summers are shorter here than back home.

From the Midwest, went to kyoto last August. The heat and humidity were bad, just sucking all of my energy and I saw less than half of what I planned to.

I did two weeks across Japan in August and yes, it was hot, but I wasn't miserable. I was in Japan! It's an incredible destination! Have a daily convenience store ice cream, stay hydrated, and go slow. The only day I was miserable was when I tried to pack too many sights into my first Kyoto day - it was like trying to see every painting in the Louvre without any AC.

The weather at higher elevations was wonderful in August. Maybe obvious, but if you can plan indoor activities like museums in the afternoon, this also helps. 

Side note, I've also been to Vietnam in August. Same deal, go slow, and go inside in the afternoon. Get a hotel with a pool.
