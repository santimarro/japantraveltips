# What are things that everyone does on their first trip to Japan that are actually not worth it?

I’m planning my first trip to Japan (mid April) and I keep hearing certain things about certain cities. 

I hear tourist attractions in Kyoto are a nightmare because of the crowds. 

I hear Osaka is overrated. 

Edit: I obviously still plan on going to Kyoto and Osaka. Just sharing stuff that I keep hearing. 

I don’t have huge expectations for Japan, I just want to see some cool things, experience what the locals do, and eat some good food.

Regardless of whether other people say they're worth it or not you still need to see them for yourself to judge. 

You wouldn't go to NYC for the first time and not go to Time Square. 


Your second trip should be when you cut out the tourist traps.

They literally call Osaka the kitchen of Japan. Definitely not overrated if eating good food is a priority for you. Osaka also has way better nightlife. I would go as far as to say Tokyo is overrated.

Being obsessed with using luggage forwarding services when you're on a budget. Just pack lighter and do some laundry, it'll save you tons of money.

Also, possibly unpopular opinion but USJ/Disney etc are such an insane thing to waste time/money on if it's your first time in Japan.

The things you mention are very general. You might LOVE a touristy spot in Kyoto. You'll have to experience things for yourself. But some things you might already know for yourself. Do you like big city center with lots of people or the opposite. Something in between? You love food? What foods do you want to eat in Japan? I for example love Kyoto cafe, and will look up many cafe beforehand. I will also be hunting sakura themed food items in spring. I love shrines and temples, gardens. Other people might be sick of it after 2 shrines. Not me. I just finished planning 2 days in Osaka, and for me it's avoiding the city center. Others might absolutely love that though. It's not that black and white, and there is no right or wrong answer or recommendation.

I see a lot of people slapping on various things in itineraries that they usually admit to not having much interest in, so....probably doing stuff they have no interest in other than that they saw it a million times on Youtube/Insta/TikTok or because everyone else said they "have to go there."

> I hear tourist attractions in Kyoto are a nightmare because of the crowds.

Crowds are basically inescapable if you want to do touristy things in Japan, especially at the height of travel season. Kyoto is where a huge number converge because it is the _de facto_ city tourists think of because they want traditional Japan vibes.

> I hear Osaka is overrated.

You'll hear the same thing for <insert any other famous city in Japan>. I love Osaka, I understand if people don't. It's a large city that people always love to contrast with either Kyoto or Tokyo.
