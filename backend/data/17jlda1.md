# Don’t go to conveyor belt sushi if you’re sick/symptomatic.

Just sat near a large group coughing and blowing their noses in a small conveyor belt sushi bar in Kyoto. They were right where the belt started so every plate passed by them. 

Everyone was staring at them. Crazy selfish behavior. Delusional to what they were doing.

You’d hope this would go without saying, but think of others! Lots of great sushi table service or takeout where you’re not germing up literally all the food people are gonna eat.

Wild.

This is why I just go to places that have tablets where you order and it’s zoomed to your table. Less time going round and round, getting contaminated

Those people are not researching on reddit. Since we are good at explaining culture things and those people are just probably using TripAdvisor.
