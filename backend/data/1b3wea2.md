# PSA: Double portions in restaurants

Inspired by an incident I overheard in a restaurant today. Two tourists tried to order a double portion of katsudon to share (they mistook it to mean 2 meals) and through miscommunication ended up with a double portion each, cue confusion.

Here’s the PSA:

 1) if the restaurant is single seating/counter seat, it’s expected for an order per person. Double portion means one person eating 2x, not 2 separate servings.

2) if the order is meant to be shared, it will say so on the menu as 2人前 for 2 people etc.

### Comment 1

Its also pretty common that restaurants might have menu items „for 2 persons“ or „for 2 or more persons“ but the price on the menu is per person and not the total price, so if you want to avoid misunderstandings, it’s better to pay close attention to the menu or ask the staff.

### Comment 2

Let me guess, they tried doing it in English with staff member not speaking English fluently and not using google translate?

So the menu had regular portion and double portion. Each person would usually order their own, but instead of ordering two regular portion, they wanted to share the double portion?

### Comment 3

Sharing of meals from a restaurant perspective is pretty rare in japan. Izakaya and yakiniku are probably the most popular. All of the other restaurant generally expect you to order a main meal per person. 

Trying to implement your own culture into a country where it differs  generally won't work well...

I’m Japanese, and I’m totally lost and don’t understand what he wanted in OP , well, I kind a do, but why??  LOL,  I can assure it was too confusing for the waiter.

### Comment 5

The portions are also bigger than you would expect! I have ordered "regular" sized meals at two restaurants and it was more food than I could eat both times lol stick to the restaurant suggested small portion! You can always get more food.
I do have to say staff doesn't care if you don't finish your food I think people online exaggerate that part.
