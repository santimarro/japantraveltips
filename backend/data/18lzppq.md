# Wanted to provide an updated experience on legally importing ADHD medication (Vyvanse) as I see a lot of dated/possibly incorrect info out there

This is my experience as of literally today. I just got back to the hotel after my first evening out in Japan, and I wanted to give some information to other people stressing over traveling with their ADHD medication.  
  
Another thing I want to note is that while Vyvanse can be approved (and mine was, details will follow) almost every other ADHD medication commonly prescribed in the US is still very much illegal in Japan, even with a prescription. Do not attempt, under any circumstances, to import them as you may well end up in jail.  
  
First and foremost, the hardest part of this entire process was dealing with the *American* healthcare side of things. I used to take Adderall, but I'd been wanting to switch for a while and this trip to Japan was a good opportunity to do so. The wait to see my primary care provider was over a month, then I had to bring him multiple pieces of example paperwork (found here: https://www.ncd.mhlw.go.jp/en/application2.html#narcotics) and he basically still didn't believe me until I pulled the website up for him. After dealing with all of the headaches of switching on the American side, I got the ball rolling on the Japanese side (at the above link).  
  
That part of the process was honestly incredibly easy. I filled out the paperwork, scanned it in, scanned the letter from my doctor, provided detailed examples as they ask for (photos of the item and the bottle) and submitted it. I received an email back confirming they had gotten it within 24 hours. Roughly 13 days later I received my paperwork with approval and a document to bring to Japan with me, present to customs and immigration, and keep with me while in the country.  
  
I highly advise only bringing what you will use specifically for your trip (and just deal with a day or two missed if there is a flight issue) so that you do not have to repeat this process for Export.  
  
Now one part of this process that feels a little "wrong" or confusing is having to check on both your Immigration paperwork AND your Customs paperwork that you're bringing prohibited substances into the country. The way the website is laid out you're saying "Yes" to the same list that also includes things like actually outright banned substances, Anthrax, explosives, etc.  
  
You do say yes, though, because the answer is yes. At the immigration step of my arrival today the man asked me, somewhat confused, why I was bringing (and openly admitting to bringing) controlled substances into the country. I explained it was medication and handed him the paperwork (three printed pages) along with my QR code and Passport. He read through it and raised a few eyebrows, before he said all appears to be fine, handed me my items back and welcomed me to Japan.  
  
Next at Customs you will have to select the same thing and it will essentially automatically flag you for enhanced/person screening as opposed to electronic easy screening. I presented the Customs agent with the same paperwork, however this time I also gave him the medication in its bottle directly. He inspected it and the paperwork, noted that the bottle said 30 units however my paperwork said 14. I told him I only brought with me what was required for the trip which he said was smart. He handed everything back, but he did ask me as he was doing so what my medical issue/use was.  
  
I explained Attention Deficit and he nodded, noting that the Narcotics Control Department only put "For treatment" on my import paperwork, not for treatment of what as my doctor/I had noted.  
  
All done.  
  
The process was painless, free, and easy as long as you give yourself the two weeks for a response from Japan and your import approval. The hardest part was the US side of everything.  
  
One last thing to note is that if you check a bag your medication needs to be in your carry-on as Immigration can request to see the item before you get your checked bag before customs.  
  
Hopefully this helps others that want to come have a dream trip to this country but are worried about the impact of going multiple weeks cold turkey on medication they've been on for decades.  
  
Edit: One thing I would like to add, this post might seem a bit ridiculous to someone who *doesn't* have ADHD - but as someone who has been dealing with it for a while I hope this helps if you do because you know the oodles of fun trying to navigate bureaucratic paperwork trails, agency contact, and scheduling can be! The process is pretty easy you just have to be proactive in giving yourself time to get it done.

Thank you for taking the time to share! This doesn't apply to me but I hope more people can see this!

(Adding some info to OP's post for anyone who might see this later.)

We have an [FAQ page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/health/prescriptions/) that goes over prescription and OTC medication import, with links to the NCD and MHLW's requirements.

When it comes to declaring your medication upon entry to immigration and customs, you _don't_ declare under the "Prohibited Articles" section of the form/Visit Japan Web. That section is for things that are literally prohibited (illegal drugs, firearms, etc.). You _do_ declare under the "Restricted Articles" section (the one right after "Prohibited"), which is for medicine that _is_ allowed by the MHLW with limits. While this isn't made clear on the form/in VJW itself, it _is_ made clear on the customs guide brochure available [here](https://www.customs.go.jp/zeikan/pamphlet/guide_e.pdf). It's also clarified [here](https://www.customs.go.jp/english/summary/prohibit.htm) on the customs website, in the sense that medicines designated by MHLW are not considered "prohibited". 

So you may get weird looks if you said yes to having a "prohibited" substance, as that's essentially the equivalent of saying something like "Why yes, I _am_ carrying cocaine with me". Instead, you were supposed to declare under "restricted". The page in VJW doesn't call it out directly unless you click the little "Precautions" link, and then the pop-up will also mention that this section is for restricted medication.

### Comment 3

Thanks for sharing your experience, OP!

I emailed Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare this week to ask about a medication. I provided the name, active ingredients, and dosage. Got a response very quickly (luckily, I'm in the clear!). I recommend anyone on medications to manage mental illness to reach out early and confirm if their prescription is legal to bring into the country. The email address is available on the US Embassy and Consulates in Japan website.

### Comment 4

So just to be clear and seek clarification: 

The steps I completed were:

1. fill out the Import/Export application along with providing the requested documentation for my Vyvanse prescription, & emailing this to the tokyoncd@mhlw.go.jp

2. Stating my prescription within the Customs fill-out form on the “Visit Japan Web”


3.  (Now this is where the confusion came in lol but I filled it out anyway) 

Filled out the “Application for Import Confirmation”  for my Vyanes. 

- 

I guess my question is, was the 3rd process needed as now I'm waiting for my application status, or were just
steps 1 & 2 suffice?

### Comment 5

Does this also need to be done with concerta?
