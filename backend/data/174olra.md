# For approx. 100$ : Is ghibli Museum worth it ?

Is it worth for that price (approx. 100$ for two Tickets) ? Normally it only cost about 10$ / ticket ‚Ä¶ ü•≤
 I did not manage to get the Tickets on the English Site ( it was my turn , but never got through and had to queue over and over for 3 1/2 hours ) Unfortunately a Japanese phone number is required since last month, to buy the tickets on the Japanese website. üíÄ

I found some freelancers from Japan that would buy me two tickets for about 100$ (on Japanese website. Is the museum worth it for that price ? 
I love all ghibli movies, but I‚Äôm worried about my expectations , that would be bigger if we pay 50$ per ticket . I‚Äôm worried that I will be disappointed for that price ü•≤ pls help me to decide

Edit: thank you all for the feedback and help !‚ò∫Ô∏è ü´∂üèº
 I will try to get tickets for December (will be there until early December ) .  If that doesn‚Äôt work , I will try to get one of the tickets for ~30$ .

I wouldn‚Äôt pay that much for tickets. I found a tour that includes tickets to the museum for 4,000 yen (27 USD) per person. You can enjoy the museum once inside for as long as you like.

It‚Äôs hard to quantify worth. Would you regret it if you didn‚Äôt go? When or do you plan to travel to Japan again? How tight is your budget and schedule? No matter what you consider ‚Äúworth it‚Äù just make sure whoever you‚Äôre going through is reputable and you know exactly what you‚Äôre getting into by hiring someone abroad to buy the tickets at that price point. (And remember, the ticket price is still the ticket price. What you‚Äôre paying extra for is a service, if that helps you manage expectations.)

I recommend [https://www.ticket-japaaan.com/](https://www.ticket-japaaan.com/). He charged me $29.85 total for 1 ticket to the Ghibli Museum, and has been very communicative with getting me tickets to many other concerts/museums in Japan. I guess I will say that my trip is coming up in about a week, so I can't 100% confirm the service, but he wouldn't sell me tickets to sold out events, and he has a lot of great reviews on facebook, but the same risk of a scam would be possible with any of these services.

Cost aside, keep in mind that when you purchase tickets on the Japanese Lawson site, the account holder's name is printed on the ticket. The Ghibli Museum staff may ask to see your ID at the entrance to check that the ID matches the name on the ticket. When I went last year, they asked me to confirm my name although they didn't ask to see my ID. There have been reports of people having trouble getting in when using tickets that a friend bought them.

If you're using a Japanese third party to buy the tickets, assume that the name printed on the ticket will be Japanese. If you clearly don't look Japanese, and the staff try to check your name/ID, you could have problems getting in.

Regarding whether $50 per person is worth it: the museum is really cool and a lot of fun. If you're a big fan of the Ghibli movies you'll probably enjoy it despite the extra cost. But you aren't allowed to take photos inside (photos are only allowed outside and on the roof), if that matters to you.

Went there in 2019 and was underwhelmed by the experience. As an adult Miyazaki enthusiast the place felt like it was made mostly for kids. The gift shop was supreme and the place is beatiful and the museum had a nice exhibition about food in Ghibli movies. But still, it felt like a themed playgound for kids.
