# The phrases I am learning for my 21 day trip. Any more suggestions that you found useful?

So far, this is what I am practicing. There are some things I really struggle with and get tongue tied but it's coming along I think.

To make things easier on myself can I just say things like "Check in onegai shimasu" or "Check out onegai shimasu" instead of using the Japanese pronouncation of these words? I really struggle with "chekkuin" and "chekkuauto" for some reason. Same with something like "Tokyo Station wa doko desuka" will someone know what I mean simply by using Tokyo Station?

Thanks!

### Comment 1

Context is key. If you come up to the hotel counter with luggage, the staff will probably ask you if you're here to check in. Similar if you approach with your hotel key and luggage around check-out time. So I don't think there's any use in considering or using the check-in/check-out phrase at all. All hotel staff will understand the English pronunciation, which honestly is as close to the English as any foreign word imported to Japanese (try makudonarudo for mcdonalds lol)

Don't say sayonara. It's kind of a stylized goodbye with a certain nuance. If you're leaving a restaurant you can just say thank you or gochisosama, don't need to give a 'goodbye' phrase. If you're taking leave of a stranger, you can just say bye-bye in English or a thank you if they did you a service (taxi, question, directions, ticket, purchase, etc.) or it's a service setting.

Don't say just 'arigato' at all unless you find some young dudes to drink with. It's certainly not forbidden and nobody will fault you, but it's so out of place in most commercial settings. Add the gozaimasu always.

### Comment 2

Watch  a YouTube video on conbini expressions. Know to respond if you want or don't want a bag (you will generally be asked this), and if you are buying something that can be heated, many conbini staff will ask if you wanted it heated. Also, I never hear sayonara for goodbye. It's generally ja ne, or even bye bye. Have fun!

### Comment 3

I studied a guidebook on my 15 hour plane ride and ended up really only needing a small handful of even what you have here. Questions like "Kore wa nan desuka" (or in my case, I just used "Kore Nani", not sure if this is just formality level thing and ruder than yours), it doesn't help when they respond in Japanese and you proceed to not understand. I scrapped that early along with phrases like "Ogenki Desuka?" (How are you) because I was thinking too much about how I normally communicate/greet in English. Similarly, phrases like asking for the bathroom or train station ended up redundant because bathrooms are everywhere and well marked, and Google maps works gloriously in Japan.

I would keep "arigato gozaimasu" and never shorthand to just "arigato". They won't care much (at least outwardly, can't say if it'll offend anyone) but they'll always add the "gozaimasu" so I figured it was safer to always respond in kind.

Depending on your itinerary, you wont need to stress too much. My trip was entirely in Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo. A lot of people could tell i was a foreigner and default started in English. Otherwise, when in doubt, just pull out Google translate and set it to conversation mode.

The only phrases that I might add which may get you through some interactions without going into English: 

Kore o [hitatsu, futatsu] kudesai -- [one, two] of this please (didnt have to go above 2 for the most part already forgot what 3 and 4 are. accompany this with pointing on a menu)

Kekkou des(u) -- no thank you 

Kureji-tto kaado de ii des(u) ka? -- Do you take credit card? (Sometimes it's not very clear if they do and they have to pull out a card reader. Alternatively, sometimes I forgot the entire phrase and after they said the total and ask for payment I just pulled out my card and said "kaado?")

Goch(i) sou sama desh(i)ta -- thank you for the meal (said after you finish eating and are heading out/going to pay the bill. I don't think they care if foreigners pull this one out but when it came to some places with more limited seating, I figured it might be good to let them know when you're done with the table)

### Comment 4

Your version of goodbye is perhaps the wrong one to use, it’s more of a final goodbye, like I am ‘never going to see you again’, which in travel kinda makes sense, you won’t be seeing these people again. But I was taught to not use it, unless there was an emotional finality to your goodbye. 

Things like jaa ne (see you) or mata ne (see you later) are perhaps way better.
