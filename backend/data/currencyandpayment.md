The easiest and best method to obtain yen is to obtain it upon arrival in Japan, either by using an ATM or a currency exchange counter. Obtaining yen in your home country is often inadvisable as the fees and exchange rate will not be as friendly to travelers as they will in Japan itself. That said, it is never a bad idea to check your local bank, as some countries and some banks may have favorable rates. You can then compare those rates online to major money exchange counters in Japan.

All major international airports and other entry points have currency conversion counters or bank branches that can convert currency for you. As you will almost certainly need cash once inside the country, it is best to obtain some cash at the airport if possible. The rates at Japanese airport kiosks are reasonable, though the best rates you'll get are from ATM withdrawals. It is recommended to have a checking/debit account which reimburses ATM fees, as ATMs in Japan are almost certainly outside of your network. Airports will also have ATMs which accept foreign debit cards.

### How much money should I carry with me?

You should always have at least ¥5000 in cash on your person. Some places, especially small restaurants/shops and areas outside major cities, still do not accept credit cards. If you are using a physical IC card in Japan, you will also need to refill that at ticket machines or convenience stores with cash.

Carrying large amounts of cash is not unheard of in Japan, and doing so is relatively safe, provided you do not misplace your wallet or bag containing your cash. You may want to bring a coin purse, as Japanese currency utilizes a fair number of coins.

It is also not unheard of to use large bills even for small transactions. Don't worry about finding a place to break a 10,000 yen bill — you can use it for basically any purchase.
