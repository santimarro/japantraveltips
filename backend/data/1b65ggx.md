# If you could only see 3 temples/shrines in Kyoto....

....which would you choose and why?

We'll be in Kyoto for 3-4 days, but have tweens with us we expect will get templed out pretty quick. We're expecting a "seen one, seen them all" mentality from them. I'd like to put 3 really interesting temples/shrines on our "must see" list, and then any others we get to can be a bonus.

To make sightseeing more fun for teens, they might also like to collect photos of Pokelids or cool manhole covers, Goshuin at shrines and temples (paid), and you can get a small, blank notebook to collect train station/tourist site stamps.

- Tip: Keep in mind, the *only* thing that goes in your Goshuin book is the Goshuin itself. Do not put stamps, stickers, or write on the pages yourself. I keep a separate sheet of paper in the front of the book and make a running list of the places I got each Goshuin.  When the book is full, *then* you can go back and write the location of the Goshuin into your book or just a small number in the bottom corner to correspond with your table of contents sheet.  
- Check out some of the gachapon (capsule toy) arcades. Be sure to take your toy out of the capsule and place it in the recycle bag/bin by the machine.  Capsules will quickly use up all the space in your luggage but the toys are quite small.

- You’ll also find travel themed gachapon in places like major train stations or sites like Arashiyama in Kyoto. Often near main temple sites.  These will be themed such as pandas to represent the zoo in Ueno or famous places in that city/region.
- When you get home, super glue magnets to the toys to make fun mementos for your fridge.

If they are trying to add to their collection they may be happy to visit more temples/shrines.  Some other ideas:

For day trips: In Kyoto, I’d suggest a day trip to Arashiyama to [ride the scenic train and take the riverboat cruise.](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/mibm8t/kyoto_sagano_scenic_train_hozugawa_riverboat/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) If departing from Osaka, and if you time it right, you can [ride the Hello Kitty Shinkansen](https://japancheapo.com/travel/hello-kitty-shinkansen/) to Himeiji to see the castle. It’s one of the few original construction castles remaining in Japan.

### Comment 2

Kinkakuji, Kiyomizudera, and Inari in nearby Fushimi.  Note that these are also extremely touristy, but are each very distinctive in their own way.

ETA: the Toei eigamura in Hanazono is incredibly campy but they might enjoy it.

### Comment 3

I’ll give you 2.

Fushimi Inari.  Classic.  Must see - everyone in our party of 6 (3 teens, 2 40 somethings, 1 late 70s) thought this one was the best.

Ryoan-Ji.  I LOVE the zen garden and you get to take the cute Radan (spelling) trams there.  They actually have a gatcha for the tram at the interchange station.

I would definitely recommend Ninnenzaka and Sannenzaka streets which on the way to the Kiyomizo dera.  I liked this area more than the temple and there is a great view of a pagoda near there.

### Comment 4

Agree on Kiyomizu-dera and Fushimi-inari. Not sure I would place Kinkaku-ji 3rd; it is not that convenient to reach and you need sunny conditions for it to really "glow". Tweens might enjoy Arashiyama with the monkey park and the bamboo; a visit to Tenryu-ji ties in very nicely with that.

### Comment 5

Kinkakuji, Kiyomizudera and indifferent on a third. 
I did like Sanjusangendo and the rock garden one also.
