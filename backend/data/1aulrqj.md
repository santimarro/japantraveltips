# Best thing you ate in Kyoto?

I‚Äôm in Kyoto for a couple more days and wanted to ask what was the best thing you had here? My friends and I love food and have been eating our way around town. We aren‚Äôt really into gourmet dining or Kaiseki meals. We‚Äôd love some recommendations and to hear what good stuff you‚Äôve had! So far, my favorites in Kyoto have been Chao Chao Gyoza and Menya Inoichi. 

Edit: thank you all for the recs!

There is a small  restaurant at the back of Tenmangu Shrine. Towards the right side. Just a screen door and a little handwritten sign. Exquisite food and although I'm a neat eater was blown away. Lots of places in Japan are like this BTW. Simple, tiny and in expensive

People are going to be pissed at this comment, but we were *really* fatigued with Japanese food and wanted to have a night off.... We went to Piopiko Mexican and the tacos were amazing! They also had great cocktails and the bar was really cool. It's in the Ace hotel building.

For anyone looking for a no frills great burger (go early, they do run out): Smile Burger near Kiyomizu, along the main road next to FamilyMart. Local beef, handmade buns üëåüèª

### Comment 4

Highly recommend Tonkatsu Katsu Hana (loved the pork katsu set with 3 different brands) and Kakyo (French inspired Japanese course meal)

### Comment 5

Unagi at Kamanza, really close to Kodaiji Temple. It has other things if you don't want to eat eel ahah
