# A few tips after our 3-week stay

Hi!   
I just came back from a 3-week trip in Japan, and here are a few tips/thoughts   
1. We had breakfast everyday at konbinis, and they were great! Lots of 7-Eleven have automatic smoothie machines, you choose your frozen fruits and it mixes them right in front of you. For people who enjoy savory breakfast, we had onigiri every morning.  
2. We never reserved trains more than 1h in advance and never had any trouble. The only problem we had was for buses in the Alps. We went from Takayama to shirakawa-go by bus, and arrived at 11 for the 12pm bus, but it was sold out, so we took the next one that left one hour after. And on the same day there was no room left for buses from shirakawa-go to Kanazawa. So I’d strongly suggest trying to reserve these buses at least the day before, or as soon as you arrive. We reserved directly at the station, no idea if you can reserve them in advance online or from other cities. For context, is was on a weekday in October.  
3. We stayed in hotels throughout our entire trip, and hotel rooms were way smaller then the ones I’m used to in Europe, and it was tricky to find room to open our big suitcases. Although it wasn't a major issue and we managed, those hesitating between a suitcase and a backpack might find this a compelling reason to choose a backpack.  
4. Initially, we were concerned that not knowing Japanese beyond 'hello' and 'thank you' would be problematic, but it turned out to be fine. Gestures got us along the way. Most restaurants have pictures included in their menue, that was very helpful. By the way, I found that Papago worked better than Google Translate.  
5. Izakaya are a stay-drink-place. If it’s written izakaya on a restaurant, I believe you are expected to order a drink along with your food.  
6. You have to take your shoes off a lot of times (when visiting temples, at some restaurants, even to try on clothes). Appart from taking confortable shoes to walk, a bonus would be taking shoes you can easily put on by standing up  
About the Tokyo subway:  
1. We downloaded a pasmo (IC) card directly on our iPhone with apple wallet, no need to buy a physical one (I guess there must be an android equivalent?)  
2. Navigating in the subway was very easy. All stations have numbers, and lines have colors. Google maps worked great, expect for one time. Google maps told us to « stay on the train » at a station, but we actually had to switch trains, because the one we were in switched direction. I have no idea what happened exactly, but if Google maps indicates a specific station with written « stay on the train », I’d suggest being extra careful.   
For people who enjoy researching restaurants on Google maps and checking grades, here are a few very specific tips. This may not be your thing and this is totally fine, food is absolutely amazing there and it’s not necessary to go through that level of research. Simply wandering around and joining any line with Japanese people is usually a good strategy. It’s just something that I enjoy doing, so here are my tips if you’re like me:  
1. How to search: if you wanna eat a specific food, like sushi, I heard you should be searching for this word in Japanese instead of English to get more results. So use Papago first. I was given this advice, and it seems to be working to me.   
2. Japanese people grade differently than europeans and Americans do. I’m used to going to 4.7 restaurants in Paris, but a 4.1 is a very good restaurant there. From my experience, a 4.1 that mostly had Japanese comments was usually better than a 4.7 that mostly had foreigner comments. So I always made sure to go to restaurants that had lots of Japanese comments (which was very often the case, but not always). But I still made sure that there was at least one comment from a foreigner, to make sure tourists are welcome.  
3. We went to a Michelin-stared ramen, and it was absolutely delicious. But at some of these popular places, getting a seat can be tricky. Some places have tickets, and you have to be there before the opening to get a ticket with a time slot, then come back and wait in line a bit more (this takes time, you may not wanna spend your precious time there, but to us it was worth the wait, we only did this a couple of time though). Most of the time, people explain the process and give advice to make sure you’re gonna get a place in the Google maps comments. I’d also suggest checking comments before going to any specific place that seems to be very popular (with lots of comments for example), to make sure getting a seat is not too hard and you won’t have to wait in line for an hour. People usually give this warning in the comments.  
4. All that being said, the best restaurants we found were still the small ones we just saw passing by, walking in the streets. Food was amazing and even though I’d personally always check a restaurant’s grade before going in, I don’t think taking the subway to go to a specific restaurant is worth it. That being said, some neighbourhoods are better than others to find good restaurants. In some neighbourhoods, there are mostly chain restaurants, in others there are almost none, while in others there are plenty of small and cute places. So if you can and want to, I’d suggest trying to eat in the right areas if this fits your schedule. This is was mostly true for Tokyo, not really for smaller cities like Kamakura.  
Our stay in Japan was absolutely amazing, and I hope you enjoy yours if you’re planning to go soon! 

### Comment 1

Reserving trains is no problem not long in advance if you do NOT have oversized baggage. That's the very important distinction. My bf and I had oversized suitcases and the few times we booked late (either the evening before or the day of) cause we forgot were hell. We had to either book a train at 6am or like 3pm for any oversized luggage seats to still be available.

1. There are a tonne of chain cafes and coffee shops (kissaten) that are also open early enough for breakfast, that serve sweet and savoury breakfast items.

### Comment 3

1. Cafes generally run a breakfast menu that's relatively inexpensive-ish. Mostly because coffee is sort of stupendously expensive in Japan. Asking for a refill you will get a look like you're asking for the Emperor to come down and server you though. Combinis are great but its not a sin to get a decent sit down breakfast either
2. This is likely mostly ok though you should definitely check if any holidays are happening during your travel. The only time I had an issue with a reservation was during a specific holiday.
3. Japanese hotels definitely are small. If you run a clamshell suitcase this can be a problem. I would recommend that you use packing cubes as organizational tools. This allows you to get at items and quickly close your suitcase without having stuff just 'everywhere'
4. The Japanese are UTTERLY BRUTAL with restaurant reviews. Tabelog, the yelp of Japan, will rank a restaurant that has a line out the door, and food that you would give up your first born for, as a 3.5 out of 5. There are ZERO I mean ZERO ramen places in Tokyo with a 4.0 rating or higher. In essence if a Japanese website gives a place a 3.5/5 its amazing. Anything above 4/5 is functionally god tier.
5. I sort of made the mistake of thinking "well I'll just flag a bunch of random stuff I see on Instagram and then walk around and see what I want to eat". This works fine except that anything on IG is going to be so immensely popular that there will be lines out the door for each one without fail. So I had a google map with a few zillion pins that were functionally useless. I simply no longer have the energy or time to sit in line for 2 hours for anything.
6. If you stick with certain cuisines like sushi, ramen, and such, there's sort of a floor as to how 'bad' it can be. There is fierce competition and if your sushi or ramen does not have the right price point/quality balance, you will be out of business so fast your head will spin. I mean there will probably be 2-3 of the same cuisine in the same BUILDING. So any such place will basically collapse pretty fast if its bad or whatever. But be warned if you venture out into cuisine where there is not such competition, such as Chinese food, you can run the risk of getting something not great (coming from Hong Kong, Japan is just too damn expensive for dimsum/yamcha. My wife yells at me the kansai pork buns are terrible but I grew up with this stuff and I'm stuffing my face with them no matter what)

7. Only on android phones purchased in Japan.

8. Not all train on a line go to the same place. So if you did not take the exact train listed on Google maps, it’s possible you took one that was not going all the way to the station where you wanted to go. The destination on the train should at least match the destination in Google maps.

### Comment 5

4. I was recommended by some locals DeepL as your translation app as it translates more accurately.
