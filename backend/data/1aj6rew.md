# 13 Hours in Japan - How I Spent My Layover

I was skeptical at first, but I was able to make the most out of a 13-hour layover in Haneda. Though many recommended focusing on 1 or 2 spots, I was able to fit in 5 places that I wanted to hit in Tokyo. Here’s how it turned out:

4:00 to 5:25 am - Arrived at Handa at 4 am. Immigration was done in less than 30 minutes. I was ready to start my journey, but the first train (Keikyu Line) out of Haneda was not until 5:25. As such, I was able to leisurely store my backpack in a locker and make my first vending machine purchase!

5:25 to 6:00 am - Took the Keikyu line to Tsukiji Outer Market (the only place with open restaurants at 6 am). Arrived at the Higashi-ginza stop, walked towards Tsukiji on a dark and cold morning, smiling as I recognized the streets of Ginza from a previous trip.

6:15 to 7:30 am - Walked around the Outer Market, had a chirashi breakfast at Sushizanmai, and lined up for a stick of sweet tamagoyaki. One stall serving hot (gyu?) rice bowls had a long line. Took the Asakusa line to the Senso-ji Temple.

8:00 to 10:10 am - Arrived at a quiet Asakusa (most shops were still closed), visited the temples and took selfies with the giant lanterns. I had time to hang out at Tully’s to replenish caffeine levels and recharge a dying phone. By 9:30, the main street was starting to get packed as more stalls began to open. After having my fix of my favorite warabimochi at Sawawa Asakusa, I headed for Akihabara.

10:30 am to 12:00 pm - Arrived at Electric Town when most shops were only starting to roll up their gates. Although Kotobukiya and Mandarake were still shuttered, I enjoyed the 7-floor ascent at Bic Camera. Next stop: Takeshita St. via the JY Yamanote line to the Harajuku station.

12:30 to 1:30 pm - Arrived at the mouth of Takeshita St. and walked from Harajuku to Shibuya. While Takeshita was cute, I enjoyed Meiji-Dori more, especially the Jordan World of Flight and Toy Sapiens stores.

1:30 to 2:30 pm - Hoped to have ramen at Ichiran, but both Shibuya branches had an hour to 2-hour wait! Found a vending machine ramen place near the crossing instead (which was mid) then walked around the area and did some last-minute shopping at UniQlo. After crossing the scramble, took the JY Yamanote line to the airport from Shibuya Station.

3:00 to 5:30 pm - Arrived at HND 2.5 hours before my flight. Was kinda bummed to be super early since immigration took only 10 minutes. I was in front of my gate and duty-free shopping by 3:30. Perhaps next time, I could spend an hour more in the city - what do you guys think?

Super helpful game-changing tips:

\- Make sure to get your QR code in advance from Visit Japan Web to expedite the immigration process.

\- Chat with the friendly people at the airport’s Tourist Info. They are open early and will help you map out your journey and navigate the trains.

\- Add and preload a SUICA card to your Apple Wallet (iPhone users). This made commuting such a breeze (I spent about 1,700 yen during this trip).

\- For UniQlo users, their clothes are about 30-50% cheaper in Japan. Time to stock up on those Heat Techs and Airisms!

If you’re planning a short trip for a long layover, I hope this helps. I also did a similar 13-hour layover blitz in Seoul, which I chronicled in /KoreaTravel.

### Comment 1

It's great you got so much done!

I would still go to airport early as it's not worth the risk to miss a flight.

### Comment 2

I think the key point here is that you seem to already knew where you are going to head to and how to get there, which most people asking the question probably don't have too much of an idea of or may be trying to min-max 12 hours in Tokyo...

### Comment 3

It's always a gamble about how long it will take to get through security. From experience, 2 hours is plenty of time, but there's always the risk of something happening, so that's a decision for you to make.

If you're flying out internationally, there's always Rokurinsha airside. Lines are so much shorter than their normal shops!

### Comment 4

Holy cow, you got a lot done in a short timeframe.  Have you been to Tokyo before?  It seems like you had a good handle on where you were going and how to use the subway system, not get lost, etc.

### Comment 5

May I ask what did you fill out on your immigration customs declaration form for address? You're supposed to fill out the hotel address for when staying in Japan. However if I am just there to walk around a few hours for a layover so I won't have an address..
