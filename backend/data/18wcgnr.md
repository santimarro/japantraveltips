# Going to Kanazawa in 8 days... : how bad will things be?

Hi. Following the recent tragedy that was the january 1st earthquake, I am very stressed about my upcoming trip. Considering the state the Shinkansens are in and the state of Kanazawa as a whole, I wanted to get opinions on if I should cancel my hotels there or no. I will be passsing by Nagano too, and I am unsure if things will get better before my arrival. Will Kenroku-en and other attractions be opened in 8 days? Is it even worth it?   


Thank you to anyone with knowledge about catastrophes in Japan, this was not expected.

Keep track on the news, but try not to go to a heavily disaster struck area where tourist will only obstruct the rescue or relieve operations

### Comment 2

I would go somewhere else. The focus needs to be on recovery and rescue efforts right now, and your presence will be taking resources from locals. Hotels are often utilized after disasters to house people. 

There are THOUSANDS of places you can go that aren’t Ishikawa prefecture or Niigata or Toyama.

### Comment 3

Japan is very good at handling these disasters and will act quickly. Some trains (Thunderbird) have already started limited service. Most newer buildings will be fine and safe. But they will make sure everything is safe before "going back to normal." There are also still earthquakes occurring, so there may still be more coming. For peace of mind, I would cancel. My son lives there (he is visiting us for New Years), and we are unsure when he can go back. Bad situation all around.

Don’t go. Cancel and go somewhere else.

### Comment 5

In 8 days, I would recommend not to go. Japanese are experts at dealing with disasters but they are no magicians. I would suggest staying in Tokyo. If the situation is fine after 8 days, you can do a day trip to Kanazawa
