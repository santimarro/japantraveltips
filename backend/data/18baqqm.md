# Non touristic spot tips Tokyo

I am going alone to Tokyo for 10 days. And as controversial as it may sound: the less touristic the beter. Atleast that has been my experience so far going on holidays.

Does anyone have good tips for places I should visit? Restaurants, bars, museums, etc.

### Comment 1

I made a list while visiting Tokyo a couple of times; feel free to use it. It includes all the places I liked and would definitely visit again.

Take a train to the suburb and stop at the end of the line, you won't find anything less touristic.

I'm solo in Japan right now. I went to the National Museum of Nature and Science this past Saturday. They have a special exhibit called "Washoku", it's about Japanese cuisine; from source to plate and all the history to go with it. They have qr codes for English audio guides.

It's Tokyo. There are tourists everywhere, and you are going to miss out on some great stuff if you try to be special and avoid touristy locations. You won't improve your trip by avoiding the Tokyo Tower, Akihabara or Takeshita Street because they're popular.

On the other hand I just wouldn't worry about reviews or Michelin stars and simply go to whatever bars and restaurants catch your attention - there's thousands of them.
