# 17 y/o in adult-only hotel?

Hi everyone, I (17) am traveling to Japan next month with my mother. I booked a room in a hotel in Osaka for one night and I just realized now that the hotel is adults-only.. When I read the policies it said that the minimum check-in age is 18 and guests 18 and over are welcome. Do you think they'll let me stay if I'm accompanied by an adult? The hotel room is booked under her name. It will be our first time in Japan and I don't know if they'll check both of our passports or just the passport of the person who booked the hotel. I can't get a refund so I'm hoping the staff will be lenient enough to let me sleep there for one night ðŸ˜­

Oh man, did you book a love hotel with your mom?

### Comment 2

You booked a non refundable hotel, adults only hotel?! 

The chances of you booking a "love hotel"  (Adults hotel) is high. I would definitely recommend you to change hotels and get a refund because they won't let you in based on age verification and you're going to possibly see some "interesting" things that you potentially didn't sign up for (and your mother!).

### Comment 3

They check everyoneâ€™s passports and make copies of them at every hotel (or at least theyâ€™re supposed to).

### Comment 4

I really think you should book another hotel to be safe.

### Comment 5

Change your hotel buddy. No further explanation. They will check your passport as well. Also even if they allow you, you will find some interesting things in the room which will make your stay with your mother awkward af. Kindly take a refund if possible, and find other hotels.
