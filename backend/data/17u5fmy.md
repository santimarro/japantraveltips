# Why do you prefer Ichiran and Cocoichi curry?

Hi, I’m Japanese living in the US! A lot of people I meet (including close friends) have been telling me how much they loved going to Japan, and I love hearing their stories. I noticed many people, and like, I mean literally every single person I talked to have mentioned they went to Ichiran and Cocoichi curry house… but WHY??? When I ask why they went the answer is usually because they “heard it’s good.” 
To me, Ichiran and Cocoichi is fast food, like McDonald’s, and the last resort when it’s 4am and you just stumbled out of a club drunk AF in Shibuya and you know you need something to fill your stomach before passing out. 

For those of you who went to either places, I’m genuinely curious, how did you hear about it and why did you decide to go there? 🙏 I also talked to my hair stylist about this phenomena when I went back to Japan and she is also curious😂

Edit: I am open to answering questions about Japan in return, thank you! 

UPDATE: 
Thank you all so much for your answers and opinions!! You guys saved me from going into a spiral of conspiracy theory like maybe the Ichiran CEO started this hype so they can make more money and take over Japan 🤣 
Seems like it is just hype around social media and convenience, makes sense! Ichiran and Coco are not bad at all! Just strange and interesting to me that everyone flocked to the same fast food chain when usually your stay in Japan isn’t long and have limited time to enjoy the thing you would. But maybe that’s why we all go to fast food places, because it’s fast! Who’s got time to search for places to eat when you have to get on the next shinkansen. 
As of my recommendation, I am from Yokohama and all my local friends go to ニュータンタン (New Tantan) lol but it’s just some random ramen place in a residential neighborhood… so here’s my more fun and interesting recommendation: ラーメン凪 aka 凄い煮干しラーメン凪 (Ramen Nagi) in Golden Gai. It will be fun just to go to Golden Gai and experience the “tired salaryman” culture of Tokyo! Have you ever watched Midnight Diner? That’s Golden Gai stuff. 
I also like 太陽のトマトラーメン if you want more accessibility. It’s a ramen chain that serves tomato ramen only.
Please keep in mind I am not a ramen snob lol.
As for curry… I think most Japanese people cook their own Japanese curry at home so I don’t know. But if you go to any shokudo (diner?) that’s been running since early showa era they will usually have the best curry ever. Maybe I will do a search and make a separate post. 
I understand it is not easy being adventurous with food when there are so many other things you need to get done on the bucket list! 
If you are in need of alternative quick meals, I recommend tachigui soba (standing counter soba) or kaiten sushi (those sushi that come to you on conveyor belt things). You’ll see them around train station areas. These might also be a fun alternative 😊✌️

When I went to the US many years ago one of things on my MUST DO list was to eat at Chipotle.

Same thing I guess.

### Comment 2

They are not ‘gourmet’ restaurants in terms of quality but very tourist-friendly. Menu is basic and familiar and ordering is super easy even without knowing any Japanese words 

Ichiban: popular with tourists mainly because of the single diner cubical (booth) and opens 24 hours. 

Coco: just like Yoshinoya, it’s popular because it’s cheap and located everywhere. 

I don’t visit Ichiran anymore because there are many better ramen places. But still going to Coco or Yoshinoya for breakfast

CoCo Ichibanya is like...in the top 3 things I miss the most. Sure it's fast food but japanese standard fast food is already a billion times better than the fast food I can get in Canada. The fried cutlets are so crunchy, whereas any 'fried cutlet' I had in fast food here were sad wet slobs of processed meat product...

It's the nostalgia man. It's not always the quality of the food that makes you like something, but the experiences that go with it. Same reason we all love the konbini's questionable onigiri and stale korokke – we just want to open that Family Mart door and hear the music. To you it's just boring everyday life, to foreigners who love Japan, there's something special about these mundane things :)

### Comment 5

the fact that i'm vegetarian and cocoichi has vegetarian curry base AND is highly customisable.

i love curry and it's always a good dinner default when i'm somewhere new and dont wanna risk places that i can't guarantee have veggie food
