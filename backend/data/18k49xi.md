# JR Pass not worth it for Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka

I feel like its not really worth it, but i see everywhere that its a must! Am i making a mistake?

Price drastically increased 3 months ago. You're probably seeing old information.

### Comment 2

It used to be. Not anymore since the price increase.

### Comment 3

They have JR pass calculators, to see if it’s worth it. 

Dont quote me on price but it was roughly one way from Tokyo to Osaka is about 12k yen (~84 USD). Going back would say cost the same so you’re looking at 160 vs one week JR pass for 330. In this scenario you will save about 200$ usd give or take. 

From Osaka / Kyoto you can take local trains and do not need to use Shinkansen to get there.

### Comment 4

Hokuriku Arch Pass may be worth it still.

### Comment 5

Because all the social media content is outdated.
