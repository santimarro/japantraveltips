# If you get sick in Tokyo go to St. Luke’s International University Hospital

I got really bad travel/motion sickness flying from Vancouver to Tokyo. I thought it would go away the next day but it stayed for 3 days, I finally decided to go to a hospital. 

The staff at St. Luke’s are incredible, they have translators available and my doctor spoke great English. They broke down the prices for me clearly and were okay with me foregoing further testing to avoid the costs. They wrote me 2 prescriptions and the entire interaction was less than 2 hours. The staff are so nice, every single one. This is a teaching hospital so you will have students in your consultation room so if you aren’t comfortable with that then I would suggest going elsewhere. They were very respectful and very kind.
