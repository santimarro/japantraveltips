# Is it tacky to travel with small gifts to give away?

I’m travelling to Japan in February to visit my niece who is studying Japanese language and culture there as a student at university.  

I’m Indigenous (Cree) - First Nations, North American Indian - for those of you not in Canada - and was thinking about making a few pairs of beaded earrings, pins, necklaces, sun catchers (etc), to give away on my trip to folks I make a particular connection with. 

Good idea? Bad idea?

They go ape over this stuff. Great move. We kept some hometown souvenirs to give to helpful folks and they generally lost their minds that a foreigner gave them a gift.

I think that’s very sweet and thoughtful of you. I don’t think many Japanese would know anything about or even heard of Canadian indigenous peoples (you can say you’re similar to the Ainu of Canada). These types of handcrafts aren’t just cheap bobbles you can easily buy in Japan; I think people will be thrilled to receive them!

Writing thank you notes on post cards from my home country is what I tend to do.   Doesn't take too much space and you can make it unique to the experience that you are tankful for.

No! I gave a small coffee shop owner a little postcard from Austin where I am from and she loved it. When we went back the next day she had it on her window seal!

Google "[omiyage](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5900f1123a04117bf4b2fd13/t/59a9c1f1f9a61ece833730bb/1504297458184/Omiyage+Guide.pdf)". Offering small gifts to hosts and/or influential individuals to your niece is not only NOT tacky, but much appreciated. They'll generally give foreigners a pass if you don't, but it is proper etiquette for Japanese visiting other Japanese people and very much appreciated when foreigners make an attempt to do the same. 

Something local (to you) is the original intention, and especially something not too extravagant, so simple gifts like indigenous necklaces, pins, and earrings are perfect, but also maybe include some food to share like jerky or dried berries.  If you really want to make an impression, find some small boxes and wrap them up, but at the very least, get some gift bags to put them in.
