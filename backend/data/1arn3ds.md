# Arriving at HND at 4:45 AM. What to do in the early morning?

Hi, doing two weeks in Japan with my first stop in Tokyo. I arrive pretty early and was gonna check out Shibuya and Harajuku on that first day but saw another comment that said being early at Senso-ji with no one around was really cool, so maybe I should do that instead? Not sure what time shops open in Harajuku.
Also saw a comment that said Shibuya Crossing was peaceful early in the morning, but seeing as it’s the “busiest intersection in the world” I kinda thought the point was to go when it’s busy? I always thought I would want to see it at rush hour. 

Any other ideas are much appreciated!

### Comment 1

shibuya crossing without people is just a really big intersection. you could maybe park yourself at the starbucks and watch the city wake up.

shops generally, including harajuku, open at 10-11ish.

maybe drop off luggage and head to the toyosu fish market for some sight seeing + delicious breakfast?

or rejigger trip so you hang out at airport and take connecting flight to other part of japan and end back in tokyo at end of trip

Just chill out in the onsens in Terminal 3

### Comment 3

depending on where you're flying from, I like to have a hotel booked already so that I can at least go take a comfortable shower and get a little bit of extra rest.

For early morning items, I definitely like to visit shrines (meiji / sensoji) but also searching out some of the neighborhood bakeries that are open earlier in the morning.

### Comment 4

Note that Japanese hotels generally don't do early check in, so if you don't book the night before you're probably looking at many hours wandering the streets jetlagged until you can check in at 3-4 pm.

Why don't you just use the time to get a train to Kyoto or Osaka or somewhere else?  Is there a reason why you have to visit Tokyo first and can't visit it at the end of your trip? Do you fly out of Tokyo?

### Comment 5

If you’re landing in Haneda at 4:45 am, by the time you deplane, go through customs, grab luggage, take a train, drop off luggage at hotel etc. I’d imagine you’d be traveling quite close to rush hour and it wouldn’t really be early morning by the time you get to a place like Sensoji.
