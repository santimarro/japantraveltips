# Going to Japan as a Heavy Dude

So a little background, I’ve always wanted to go to Japan and my friends and I are finally going next week. We decided to start planning in July 2024 when I was 320lbs at 5ft 7in. I knew it’s gonna be a lot of walking so that month I decided to start working on my fitness. From July 2023 to today I have lost about 66lbs and now weigh 250lbs. Last week I went to the gym 4 times, 1 hour each session, walked for 5km-5.5km per session and cover 23km in 4 sessions in 4 days. Will I be able to manage the walking?

Congrats on your weight loss and keep it up

Yes - you will be able to manage the walking. You are allowed to sit down and rest instead of trying to rush walking everywhere.

Walk - rest - enjoy the sights

### Comment 2

If you can comfortably walk 8-10 miles a day for a week straight, you’ll be fine. Good luck.

### Comment 3

Compression shorts, baby powder, and comfy shoes. You’ll be good. Congrats on the weight loss!

### Comment 4

I'm bigger than you, work a sedentary job, and rarely work out.  I was averaging about 15 miles a day of walking in Tokyo.  Good shoes with good insoles was key.  Dr. Scholl's Heavy Duty Support Insoles were life savers for my feet.  I don't think you will have any issues.  As a big dude, I found the narrow aisles in some stores more of an issue than anything.  Have fun!
