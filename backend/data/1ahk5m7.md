# Planning trip with my girlfriend and wondering if she’ll have any problems in Japan?

To better explain this I’m white and thin but my girlfriend is black and plus sized, and I know she would be out of place in Japan when we go. I want to know if she would face any discrimination or harassment during our trip? If anyone has first hand experience or has any insight I would appreciate it. 

This is my first post here, so I don’t know if this is an appropriate question or not.

no discrimination but the whole space thing might be a challenge for her

I'm white but plus size (size 16, short) and while no outright discrimination, you will have a very hard time finding clothing if that is something you want. Even when I was a standard size, my curves made things like buying jeans or wearing the complimentary onsen/capsule pj's a no go.

There are black people in Japan. As long as she isn't trying to hustle the locals you'll be fine.  if she very in the plus size category you might get some folks staring, but it likely won't amount to much more than that.   


If she wants to shop for clothes that will be a challenge. Also things might get a tad tight in certain areas while in shops. (This was my biggest issue at 6ft 260 pound)  


My biggest concern for her would be the walking. You will walk a TON! I cannot stress that enough.  I went from a sedentary day to day (2-4k steps) to hitting 25k steps on average.   I really recommend getting into a walking routine at least a monthish prior to the trip and hopefully average around 10k steps a day.  Also get some comfy walking shoes!

It depends where you are going. If you stick with the main tourist friendly zones like Kyoto, Hakone, Tokyo hotels and markets and shrines etc…no one will notice or care. You will be in large and very diverse crowds. If you want to get off the beaten path and travel independently to small villages, you both will stand out and will no doubt have some weird interactions but so what? Enjoy your trip!

I’m a plus sized black woman (size 16) and recently visited Japan with my husband. I didn’t experience any discrimination or harassment during my trip. People stared at my husband a bit as he’s slightly above the average male height but that was it. It might have also been because we’re foreigners who knows. I felt comfortable and welcomed everywhere we went. I did a lot of solo exploring when I woke up earlier than him and no one ever bothered me. 

I did a tiny bit of clothes shopping at GU. I walk pretty regularly so didn’t have issues with 22k step days. 

My only advice would be to lookup the weather and pack accordingly. Finding clothes in Japan is a little tougher than at home depending on her size.
