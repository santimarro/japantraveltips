# Is the cheap Don Quijote luggage  actually good?

Listen, I know everyone buys the cheap luggage at donki just to luggage home all the crap they bought, but I actually need a new suitcase for my regular travels, and I'm hoping to take advantage of the exchange rate here to get a good deal on a rather decent item as opposed to just buying something back home. Has anyone who purchased some of the stuff at donki found that the suitcases actually hold up? If so, I'd love to hear what brand you purchased. 

Thanks!

When I went they didn't have any cheap -_- I went to ginza Karen and paid 12500 yen for a medium and a carry on. Very impressed, both are 4wd and have straps and pockets for things. Both are hardshell expandable, came with letter stickers. He has multiple colours and sizes aswell, would recommend.

Went to Japan in 2016 and 2018. I bought a suitcase from Donki on both trips and both suitcases are still holding up well. Most recently used on a two week holiday in Canada a few months ago.

you could try a more mid range store like Tokyu Hands - I've shopped there for a backpack before, they actually had the brand I was already using back at home (Incase) but also a lot of Japanese brands that looked similar quality / similar or better value.

Paid around $60 for my hot pink monstrosity ten years ago and it's still traveling the world with me! No lie, basically as good as the day I bought it.
