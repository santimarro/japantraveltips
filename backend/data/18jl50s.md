# Can vegans drink Pokari Sweat?

How do they harvest the sweat? Are the pokari humanely treated?

### Comment 1

Vegetarians can as it doesn’t contain actual Pokari meat but I don’t think vegans would because it’s still come from a pokari

### Comment 2

No Pokari were harmed in the making of this drink

### Comment 3

Funnily enough, the Pokari actually benefit from a light round of cardio that encourages them to sweat. In turn keeping them fit and healthy

### Comment 4

Am I missing something or why is everyone spelling Pocari wrong

### Comment 5

This isn't what I expected when I opened the thread
