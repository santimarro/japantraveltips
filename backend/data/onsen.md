# onsen

An _onsen_ (温泉) is a hot spring bathing facility that uses natural hot spring in the baths. Onsen must meet minimum water temperature and water minerality in order to be officially considered an onsen. This is different from a _sento_ (銭湯), which just use normal hot water in their bathing facilities. Onsen a typically located in rural areas or mountain towns (often referred to as "onsen towns"), as that's where those sources of natural spring water exist. A _ryokan_ (旅館) is a traditional Japanese inn, and while ryokan can have onsen facilities onsite or nearby, the two words are not synonymous or interchangeable. Onsen can exist without ryokan, and ryokan can exist without onsen.

At an onsen facility, there are typically both public/shared baths and private baths. Patrons visiting an onsen typically bathe and relax together in shared facilities, although you can often reserve a private bath/room for families or groups of friends, often for a fee.

#### How do I use an onsen?

Onsen are meant to be enjoyed naked, and they are gender separated to keep all patrons comfortable. Although there are some _very rare_ exceptions to this, you should generally expect to enjoy the onsen naked, and you should generally expect all shared/public onsen facilities to be gender separated.

The most basic way to enjoy an onsen is to take off your clothing in the locker room, store your belongings in a locker/basket, shower (with soap) at the shower facilities, and then soak in the spring water pools.

#### How do I find a good onsen town?

The simplest answer to this is to search the internet with a term such as "onsen town near XYZ" where "XYZ" is whatever major city you'll be near on your trip (example: "onsen town near Tokyo").

#### I am afraid of being naked in front of strangers! Can I wear a bathing suit in an onsen?

Generally speaking, no. With the exception of some rare onsen resorts targeted to families with young children, the majority of onsen in Japan do not allow clothing or bathing suits to be worn in the onsen waters for hygienic reasons. At onsen with mixed-gender baths (baths in which men and women share the same facilities), women **may** be allowed to use a facility-provided towel to cover their breasts or genitals. (Personal towels cannot be used, again for hygienic reasons.) However, many mixed-gender onsen do not offer this service.

Due to changing social norms surrounding mixed-gender nudity, the majority of onsen in Japan are separated by gender. This means that, in public facilities, you will only use changing rooms, bathing facilities, and baths with individuals of the same gender as you. However, if you are still nervous about being nude in front of others regardless of gender, there are still some options available to you.

Some onsen resorts or day onsen offer a private bath, sometimes referred to as a "family bath," for reserved use. Occasionally, family baths are offered free of charge to guests of a ryokan or hotel, but the vast majority of these private onsen facilities require a small fee, ranging anywhere from ￥500-4000 for a reservation. Reservation lengths vary by facility, but most are 45 minutes to 60 minutes. Additionally, most facilities only allow guests to reserve these baths upon arrival at the onsen, hotel, or ryokan. Please inquire with the facility you wish to visit to confirm their policies. (Onsen rules and availability are almost always available on a facility's website.)

If you will be staying at a ryokan or hotel with onsen facilities, your lodging might offer in-room baths in certain rooms. These are generally very easy to spot when making hotel or ryokan reservations. Not all facilities offer in-room baths, and the cost for these rooms is significantly more expensive than rooms without a bath.

#### I am transgender/gender non-conforming. Can I use an onsen?

Individuals who do not identify as their birth-assigned sex must take great care in using onsen facilities. Transgenderism is treated as a very taboo subject in Japan, and the prevalence of transgendered individuals is very low. Similarly, public understanding of gender non-conforming individuals is not as widespread as it may be in western countries. As a result, transgender individuals run the risk of being arrested, assaulted, or otherwise placed in harm's way if they were to visit an onsen without taken proper steps to ensure their presence would not disturb others.

If you are transgender and have not had top/bottom surgery (i.e.: present as male, but retain female genitalia; present as female, but retain male genitalia) you should **under no circumstances** use a public bath, mixed gender or gender separated. Your appearance will be the source of a lot of confusion, and other patrons might be made extremely uncomfortable by your presence. For these individuals, visiting an onsen, ryokan, or hotel with private family baths or in-room onsen is the best (and, frankly, only) way to partake in onsen use.

If you are gender non-conforming (i.e.: dress androgynously, but have had no surgery to alter your physical appearance), **use the onsen that corresponds with the sex you were assigned at birth**. If the thought of using a gendered facility or being around individuals of one gender is psychologically/emotionally distressing for you, then it is best to follow the guidelines given above and to only utilize private or in-room baths.
