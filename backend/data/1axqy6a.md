# APA hotels are owned by right wing extremists

As the title says. I’m planning our upcoming trip to Japan and was reminded of this. 

We stayed at an APA Hotel in Hokkaido, and when I told my dad he was like, hmmmm… there’s something about those hotels… but what it is I can’t remember…

We checked into the hotel, and as I was unpacking our bags my husband found some English language literature in the nightstand and started reading it. After a few minutes, he says to me, “huh I didn’t know all this stuff about WW2. Apparently Japan had no choice but to join the war?”

I took the book from him and started reading it. It was immediately apparent that it was right wing propaganda, full of revisionist history. 

When we got back from our trip, I mentioned this to my dad and he goes, “oh yeah! That’s what I was trying to remember”.

So anyways if you don’t want to support this sort of thing stay away from APA hotels. They are reasonably priced and tend to be conveniently located, but there are usually lots of other options.

### Comment 1

TLDR: General sentiment is to use other business hotel chains (say Sotetsu Fresa, Tokyu Stay, Daiwa Roynet, MyStays, Toyoko Inn etc.) before using APA, because of the propaganda found in the rooms and the failed earthquake safety checks in the past. Thus said, if you are booking in the boondocks or last minute, nobody will judge you, as APA is usually last reasonably priced, reasonable quality option available in some areas.

Did you enjoy the free adult AVOD they offered?

Japan in general is full of revisionist history about their role in WW2 no? There's a significant amount of denial about their atrocities and actions during that period nation wide isn't there?

My 2c that nobody asked for, I gathered when I was there from their Tv and a few younger people I spoke to in bars; their country is full of boomers, or their version of boomers, being a large population bubble.

They vote conservative, they convict everyone that ends up in a court room, they don't want to learn anything new ( or any truths that would force them to change their lifestyle ) and a lot of japanese millennials can't wait for them to die off so they can try and make their lives slightly less shit

### Comment 5

How did I know from reading the title, there would be a far more nuanced explanation. Revisionist history is extremely widespread especially in Japan. Whether by choice or through failures in the education. Even UK has been doing that for centuries, Australia and US, all denying or trying to change key historical facts to suit their narrative. All of them do it a lot surrounding the wars of the century. Sadly not everyone can be like Germany. 

Personally I wouldnt stay at them, extremists are a bit of a stretch.
