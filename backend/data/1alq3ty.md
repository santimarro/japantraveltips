# What you wish you DID NOT pack going to Japan?

What were some things you wish you didn't pack going to Japan? I see a lot of those what to pack blogs and videos but not so much on what they wish they didn't bring or an unpack video. I know it also depends on the seasons and where you'll be traveling, so this is particularly requesting for some tips on what NOT to pack for about 10 days in Tokyo starting next week. To start, I plan to pack light with layering clothes, light makeup products, a couple of good winter coats/jackets, do laundry at the Airbnb or a hotel, pack one pair of good walking shoes, light and packable duffel bag, and bring a good size purse or tote bag. I usually travel only with a carry on and a backpack or tote bag, but may consider checking in a larger suitcase for my purchases in Japan. Thanks!

Edit: Wow, didn't expect so many replies to this! Lots of good tips here, and not just for winter but Japan in general. Will definitely go as light as possible to save space and buy another duffel or suitcase there if I really need to. Thanks everyone!

I bought my Nintendo Switch with me. I did not play my Nintendo Switch.

Too much damn clothes.

### Comment 3

Things I regret packing that can apply to more general travellers:

1) Extra clothes. Considering there is laundry facilities in a lot of hotels, the extra shirts was entirely not necessary. Plus since I was solo travelling, nobody cared if I was fashionable or not anyway. 

2) Soap and shampoo. A lot of hotels provide toiletries. Even if they didn't, a lot of convenience stores sell them too.

I wish I hadn’t brought a second pair of shoes. I brought them in case I needed something that weren’t trainers, but I ended up choosing comfort every time. Never needed fancier shoes, but maybe I’m just a plebe.

I also wore my pajamas less often than I thought because the hotel issued pjs were quite comfy.

Hydro flask (vending machines are everywhere, you’re going to want to try the drinks, and it just takes up too much space)

iPad (never used it and it was annoyingly heavy in my backpack)

Too many clothes (bought so many in Japan, their Uniqlo is like half the price of ours!! Next time I think I’m just going to bring underwear and like two outfits. DON’T heed this advice if you’re over a US size L)

Full containers of vitamins (I wanted them to be in their original packaging but they never checked. They took up so much space when I could have just used a ziploc or smaller container. I would keep prescription medicines in the original containers though)

Cash (getting yen at the bank in the US wasn’t worth the trouble when there’s ATMs literally everywhere. I also started in Tokyo where I never had to use cash so I had plenty of time to get some for later)

Travel size skincare/toiletries (bought a cute Hada Labo travel kit at konbini and never ended up using the ones I brought. Japanese skincare is a lot better than whatever it is we have. Same for makeup)

Hand towel, coin purse (so many cute and cheap options in Japan that you can pick up right away at the major train stations)

I wouldn’t worry too much about forgetting to pack something because you can buy almost everything you can possibly imagine in Japan. Just don’t forget the important stuff and you’ll be fine!
