# Can I enter Tokyo Station for the restaurants without a ticket? Will it charge my Suica?

Tokyo Station (or any other station for that matter?)

### Comment 1

Your Suica will be charged 150 yen per every 2 hours inside the station. Search 'platform ticket' for more info, but now that it's automatic with Suica, not much more to it I guess. 140 yen in Osaka area and up to 200 yen in Hokkaido.

### Comment 2

I think the OP means going to the shopping/dining areas within the Tokyo station building. OP - you will not be scanned when you enter the station building, only when you go near the tracks. You can go all around the building g without scanning your card (or phone). You don’t need a suica card to dine or shop there

### Comment 3

There is a ticket you can buy that lets you enter/exit the station. Its not that expensive but it does let you explore the station

Note that most stations have most of their food/restaurants outside the station. Tokyo Station is functionally like 5 malls slapped together surrounding Tokyo Station itself.

### Comment 4

Yes, if you enter the areas behind the gates. There are huge parts of the station that aren’t behind gates with lots of restaurants and shops though. B1 level has a lot areas free to access.

### Comment 5

All the restaurants downstairs with the stores are before the ticket gate, nothing required to get there. You can get a platform ticket for a buck for anything beyond the gate though no problem.
