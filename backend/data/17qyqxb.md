# Beating the crowds in Kyoto (my experience so far)

As a reference my travel dates are the first half of November which seems to be low season for occidental tourism but maybe high for national tourism due to momiji. 

I will just add bullets so it's easier to read and write

We did the following at weekdays: 

- Arishiyama: we arrived before 10 and there were already some crowds. We passed by around 15:30 and it was CROWDED (also a bit hyped imho). Instead I recommend taking a stroll to the Otagi Nenbutsuji Temple via the Saga Toriimoto Preserved Street, stopping in the Adashino Nenbutsuji Temple (they have a nicest bamboo grove) and shop at the Cocoon shop (so beautiful and affordable!). We also spent two hours with the snow monkeys, totally worth it. 

- Kinkakuji: We arrived at 9:15, already somehow crowded but still walkable. We were able to take nice pictures. I feel it gets impossible a couple of hours later. 

- Philosophers path and Eikan-do temple: somehow it felt not that touristy. I'd go there anytime, specially when the other places are packed. There are small shops and art galleries. 

- Nijo castle: we were there around 10, it was quite fine!! I expected crowds but there were none.  

- Gion: we went for a stroll at 3pm and there was a light rain.. apparently that was enough to scare the crowds. 

- Fushimi-Innari: we arrived around 3pm and took about 2hours to go to the top and back, there are sooo many beautiful shrines on the way.. you know the deal, just keep walking and eventually the crowds will fade. Anyways, the shrines are nicer the higher you go. 

Note: ofc there were some school groups but they are very respectful and won't bother, they usually go fast so you can just let them pass. 

Weekend:
- Uji: magnificent town and not crowded at all. I recommend having a traditional lunch at an original tea house, we did an early lunch (about 11:30) to avoid having to wait in line. 

- Nara: we arrived quite late (11:30am or so) and it was crowded!!! but I recommend walking all the way to the Kodaji temple first but via the Yoshikien Garden. Few people went that way and the path is nicer, you can also visit the gardens. 

Bonus: the closer the deer are to the station, the less hungry they will be. When we were on our way back, they were already lazy and falling asleep with their big bellies and tons of cookies on the floor, they didn't care about eating anymore. The ones closer to the Todai-ji Nigatsudo (February Hall) were bowing and doing nice tricks in order to get food, also.. it is less crowded the closer you get to this area. 

Edit: typos and grammar (I wrote this half asleep in the train hahaha sorry).

I just went to Mt Inari myself. I can confirm, most people don’t go all the way up. If you want to have the lower parts less crowded, go at around 8am.

### Comment 2

Best tip I saw (and did) was go to Fushini Inari at night. We were one of 2 groups at the top, and probably saw 6 groups total the whole climb.

### Comment 3

Currently in Kyoto also, and I’ll add that it rained when we went to Kiyomizudera and it was still slammed with people. Fushimi Inari was bad around 11 but ok on the way back (1ish), although our standards for OK are prob different bc we’re from NYC. Kinkakuji had a fair number of people around noon but not so bad that we had 0 privacy, although we enjoyed Ryoanji and Ninnaji much more. We hit Nijojo around 2-3 and there were again, some crowds, but not bumper to bumper. Worst was probably Sannenzaka around mid day, but unsurprising in hindsight. 

I kept hearing that Kyoto is bad with crowds but it’s not enough to really ruin our enjoyment. Can still pretty easily get photos without other people in them and without getting in anyone’s way, but admittedly our tolerance for that is very VERY different than most people’s lol

### Comment 4

Kyoto also has a travel congestion forecast that predicts how crowded popular tourist spots would be at specific times. You can use it as a resource as well here: https://global.kyoto.travel/en/comfort/

### Comment 5

I totally second how beautiful and uncrowded the Otagi Nenbutsuji - Saga Toriimoto - Adashino Nenbutsuji area was for a nice afternoon (even during the height of sakura season earlier this year).
