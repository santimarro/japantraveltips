# Trip Report from a Foodie 10/30 - 11/10, Tokyo-Nara-Osaka-Sapporo-Tokyo. VERY long and detailed

Very long post, listed favorite spots at the end

This was kind of a spur of the moment trip.  We've been to Japan once already right at the beginning of the pandemic and had an amazing time.  Back in September, friends of ours went to Japan but didn't really enjoy it due to extremely poor planning.  It honestly irritated me that they went to Japan and didn't even try a bowl of ramen or any Cremia/Hokkaido soft cream.  They completely wasted a trip to Japan.  Watching their IG stories gave me extreme FOMO.  I randomly checked the exchange rate and was shocked that it was 147 yen/ 1 USD.  It was around 109 when we last went.  A few days later we booked a flight to Japan, binged youtube and started planning where we were going to stuff our faces.  Like all of my other trips, my itinerary was very aggressive and food focused.  I ate so much, I can't remember everything I ate.

**Goals for this trip:** Try every curry bread I run into, eat a different ramen daily, eat Cremia/ Hokkaido soft cream daily, return with a bunch of yuzu products and japanese ingredients to start cooking japanese food at home.

**10/30 -ARRIVAL,** **Landed at NRT around 3:30 pm**.  

**Visit Japan Web QR** codes greatly sped up immigration and customs.  We had a cousin tag along who did not do the QR codes and had to wait about 15 mins for them to get through the lines.  Saw a drug sniffer dog at baggage claim, so don't think about bringing any drugs.  Wife had syringes for medication.  We had the "**Yunyu Kakunin-sho**" approved within 2 days.  Completely forgot to notify customs officer but no one asked us anything.  Once we got through, exchanged some money (best rates in Japan were seen at NRT) we picked up Pasmo Passports as souvenirs (already loaded up iphone SUICA as our primary IC card), Skyliner tickets and bullet train tickets to Kyoto from a kiosk (mistake, will explain later).  Checked into **Minn Ueno Iriya**, decent hotel with a kitchen a little farther out but relatively very spacious (\~425 sqft) and right by the Hibiya line.  Dropped off our stuff and immediately hopped on the train to Shinjuku.  

Got **Ramen Hayashida**, a sister ramen restaurant from **Ramen** **Hosenka**, our favorite last trip.  Had great shoyu ramen with the best eggs with super red yolks, Maximum Koitamago, 8/10.  Stopped by an **Excelsior Cafe** for **Cremia.**  Headed over to **Zonbun,** a kinmedai, golden eye snapper restaurant for dinner #2.  One of my favorite fish thats hard to find in the US.  They had a great kinmedai carpaccio with shredded shiso, sashimi was standard and overpriced, 7/10.  Stopped by 7/11 for booze and a curry bread.  Curry bread exceeded my expectations, curry was ok but bread had great texture, 6/10. Headed over to **Kabukicho Tower** to check out Kabuki Yokocho.  Lively and colorful place reminded me of Robot Restaurant.

**10/31 - First Full Day, Halloween**

Hopped on the Hibiya line at 8 am, which is packed like a sardine can until \~11am.  Got in line at **Chuka Soba Ginza Hachigo, a 1 Michelin star** ramen shop.  Arrived \~8:30 am for tickets and there were 40 people in front of us.  There was a group of 4 in front of us and an employee told them they didn't have enough (70 bowls daily).  The last 2 bowls went to us!  Got tickets around 9:15am for 2:25PM timeslot.  They apparently have an online reservation system now with limited walk-in seats.  Headed over to **Glitch Coffee Ginza**, one of the hottest coffee shops in Japan/World. r/espresso went crazy over Glitch the past few weeks.   Several locations in Japan, this one was very small.  They have \~15 different beans with different prices to choose from.  You choose your bean and how you want it.  We got a pour over and a cortado, 10/10.  My cortado was 2000 yen, which many would consider extremely expensive, but it was extremely well made, zero bitterness.  People overpay for shitty beer and wine all the time and don't bat an eye.

Picked up 72 hr metro passes and headed over to **Art Aquarium Museum**.  It was honestly underwhelming and pretty lame.  The exhibit had a lot of cheap looking plexiglass.  Stopped at the shops in the basement and picked up a bunch of snacks.  Stopped by **Tendon Tenya**.  Ordering was easy with the tablet, food came out quick and was cheap.  Tempura wasn't crispy but it was decent overall.  Liked that you could choose less rice and they discounted 50 yen, 6/10.  Stopped at another basement food court/ grocery store to shop.

Arrived for our ramen reservation.  First thing you notice is that the restaurant and kitchen is extremely clean, which is very different from other ramen shops.    I believe the chef is classically trained in French fine dining and wanted to step away from that and serve ramen.  We got the most expensive option at 2200 yen that included egg, chashu and truffle foie gras ravioli.  Also got a bowl of the rice and pork on the side.  Best way to describe the broth is extremely clean tasting.  Its a duck, chicken, scallop and shiitake broth thats golden yet clear, like a french consomme.  Noodles were the perfect texture, egg and pork were standard, ravioli extremely rich and fragrant. 9.5/10.

Headed back to hotel to drop stuff off, take a break and headed back out to Shibuya for Halloween.  Hit up **Joel Robuchon Cafe** for a curry bread,9/10, one of my favorite items from my last trip.  **Pierre Herme** for a mille feuille,10/10, an item  I craved the most from my Paris trip.  Was super excited to find out they had locations in Tokyo. **Tokyu Food Show** , one of my favorite places in Tokyo for random goodies and **Obscura Coffee**, large variety, like their Ethiopian beans 8/10.  Dinner at **Tsuru Ton Tan Udon** on 13th floor of Shibuya Scramble Square with good view of Shibuya Crossing and the Halloween madness.  Broth and udon texture were ok, would not return, 5/10.  Least favorite items we ate so far.  Stopped at **Din Tai Fung** next door for shrimp rolls and dessert buns, 7/10.

Headed down to the chaotic streets of Shibuya for Halloween.  It was jam packed with tourist, locals and police.  Many sections roped off to control the flow of traffic.  Cops were blowing whistles every 1-2 seconds and would yell at you if you stopped moving.  Not as many people were dressed up as I expected.  I guess bc so many tourists flocked there.  Walked around for maybe an hour and left.  Saw some cool costumes but overall kinda boring.

\*Google Maps is very good for getting around but can be tricky for dense areas like Shibuya where many buildings have many floors and the location of a business on the map may not be accurate.

**11/1 - Some Fine Dining**

**Joel Robuchon Cafe** in Shinjuku for Curry bread and pastries for breakfast. **Tokyo Milk Cheese Factory** for cookies and chestnut cream puff.  Tried to go to Miyazaki Products shop but they were closed so headed down to **Akomeya** in Shibuya since we had a lunch reservation close by.  Found a lot of great products and souvenirs there.  Picked up senbei, dashi, furikake, rice and a bunch of condiments.

**Shinkansen Tickets** \- saw a JR office so decided to stop in to clarify our Shinkansen tickets.  Bought 3 tickets to Kyoto from a kiosk when we landed (JR counter line was super long and slow) and total came to \~$150 and that didn't sound right bc tickets were suppose to be \~$100 each.  I rushed to buy them bc we were leaving on 11/3, Culture Day and morning reserved seats were sold out.  Rep explained to us that we purchases a half ticket, still unsure what that meant and don't understand what would stop us from getting off in Kyoto.  Ended up buying the other half of the ticket for non-reserved seats.  Was initially super anxious about getting a seat until the rep said there was a train every 10 min that morning.

**Lature, 1 Michelin Star + Michelin Green Star** (awarded for sustainability)

Definitely the most interesting meal I had in Japan.  Had the Lature Plus lunch menu for \~$45 USD consisting of 7 courses which was a steal.  The restaurant specializes in game meats which the chef hunts himself.  During my last trip to Japan, the wildest thing I ate was horse sushi and tartare and a whale skewer.  The first course at Lature blew that away.  A deer blood macaron.  Fucking deer blood!  Sweet, savory and gamey.  Wasn't delicious or bad, just interesting.  Wife couldn't stomach it, but I ate it up.  There was also a pate en croute made with Bear, Badger, Wild Boar, Deer and Foie Gras.  The file fish and deer filet were amazing.  Would definitely return. 8/10

**Mipig Cafe** \- fun cafe with tons of micro pigs running around.  Some were not micro and were fairly large.

**ESqUISSE, 2 Michelin Star, French**

One of the best 2 star restaurants I've experienced.  The director, who served us about 80% of the meal, spoke perfect English, explained every dish in great detail and was extremely accommodating.  Standouts for me were the homemade sourdough and the cheese course.  I don't even like sourdough but theirs was amazing and the smell was incredible.  The sourdough is made with french wheat that they grind into flour daily and allowed to ferment for 2 days leading to a bread that isn't too chewy and had a nice crispy, not hard, crust. The cheese made with kombu, sake and truffle had the most complex flavor profile I've tasted.  Dinner was 80,000 yen for 2 and I would definitely return. 9.5/10

**11/2 - Shopping, Tsukiji, Bird Land**

**Ueno Station**\- Tried to find the ramen vending machine and failed.  Spent about 30 min and could not find it.  Google maps sent me in circles.  Tokyo train stations are BIG and very easy to get lost in.  None of the employees were able to help us.

**Tokyo Station** \- decided to scope out tokyo station since were heading there early next morning for the Shinkansen to Kyoto.  Did some shopping at the gift shops.  We knew we were going to be buying a lot of stuff to bring back so we figured it would be best to buy everything we knew we were going to buy as soon as we find it so we're not scrambling the last fews days.  Found **Tsuta** soba noodle kits which I thought were only available at Tsuta locations.  Tsuta was the first ramen shop awarded a Michelin star.  Made one this morning and it was excellent.

**Matsuya Ginza** \- picked up a bunch of soy sauces from the soy sauce stand and other condiments.  Also got dirt cheap wagyu to cook for breakfast the next morning.

**Tsukiji**\- Holy shit, it was packed.  I wanted to leave shortly after arriving.  We ended up stopping by **Maruyama's Seaweed**, where Jiro and other Michelin starred restaurants source their nori.  Grabbed lunch at a random kaisendon spot.  It was good but seemed a little overpriced.8/10

**Bounce Luggage Storage**\- dropped off luggage filled with food and souvenirs at a liquor store using the Bounce platform.  Quick, cheap and easy to use.  Insured up to $10,000.

**Bird Land - 1 Michelin Star Yakitori**

Incredibly difficult to find but they served the best yakitori I've had.  Some pieces were cooked medium to medium well but I had no worries.  Enjoyed watching the chefs grill directly in front of me and the service was great but I would not return.  Yakitori is something where you can hit diminishing returns fairly quickly.  Although it wasn't extremely expensive (\~$50 pp), you can find yakitori that's 80-90% as good for a fraction of the price. 9/10

**11/3 Culture Day, Shinkansen to Kyoto/Nara, Osaka**

**Tokyo Station** \- Took an Uber since there was no way we were getting on the Hibiya early in the morning with luggage.  Hard enough to get on holding nothing.  Instead of taking the earliest train to Kyoto, we got on the platform and waited in line for the next train, ensuring a seat and luggage storage.  The line behind us got very long as the next departure approached.  When it got to Shinagawa, a ton of people were stuck standing for the ride to Kyoto.  Mt Fuji didn't look as nice this time.  There was very little snow on the mountain.

**Kyoto Station** \- Hit **DONQ** bakery and found a curry bread that was better than Joel Robuchons.  Theirs had a soft boiled egg inside.  Their canneles and mini croissants were crispy and great too. 10/10.  Took the train over to Nara.  Heres where I learned that "limited" meant reserved tickets only.  Initially scanned in, had to exit to leave and buy tickets, tried explain to the rep the situation but ran out of time and decided to eat the cost (\~700 yen) of scanning out in Nara.

Nara - Arrived on Culture Day and there were people dressed up and parading down the sidewalk.  It was HOT.  Sun shining and no clouds or shade.  Tried to go to Soba Dokoro Kitahara but line was extremely long and not moving so we went straight to the Todai-ji Temple.  I think admission was 600 yen, cash only.  The Buddha there was HUGE.  Pictures will never really show how big it truly is without a Tokyo Banana for scale.  Stopped Deer Park to feed the deer.  Hungry fuckers kept pulling my shirt.  

**Kakinohazushi Hiraso Todaiji** \- apparently open for over 100 years, this tiny shop serves kakinoha-zushi, a traditional style of sushi from Nara that is wrapped in persimmon leaf as a method of preserving the fish along with rice that is more vinegary than usual.  An American in line in front of us gave us the run down and described the sushi as more umami.  When it was his turn to order, he spoke fluent Japanese, surprising both us and the employees.  This was the biggest culinary surprise of the trip.  We ordered the 3 pc mixed (mackerel, salmon, conger eel) and the grilled mackerel with yuzu which was not wrapped in persimmon leaf, recommended by the American.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  The fish was very thin and the rice was thick and compacted, the opposite of what we prefer but is was so good.  The rice was so flavorful.  The grilled mackerel was a whole filet pressed onto rice.  Larger fish to rice ratio but equally delicious.  The salmon was our favorite.  We stopped by another shop selling the same type of sushi but it wasn't as good.  We returned to buy more of the salmon which was our favorite.  My fatass really wanted to buy another yuzu mackerel but we were so stuffed and had dinner plans.10/10

**Nakatanidou** \- viral mochi pounders and slappers.  Line was very long but moved very fast.  The fresh mochi was soft and had a bean filling.   I'm not a big fan of mochi but thought it was very good. 8/10

**Osaka** \- took train over and checked in **Sotetsu Gran Fresa** located right by Dotonburi. Hotel was much larger, busier and rooms were cheap and tiny.  

**TeamLab Botanical Gardens**\-  Was a big fan of Planets and Borderless in Tokyo so we had to go to this one.  About a 15 min walk from the subway stop, this attraction was lame and a complete waste of time.  I don't know if it was because it was overcrowded but none of the lights and sounds felt reactive.  It just felt like a dark park with random lights.  One exhibit was just a bunch of giant inflatable tube men/ air dancers lol.

**Dotonburi** was jam packed.  Reminded me of Halloween in Shibuya. There were piles of trash all over and the subway/sidewalks were much dirtier than Tokyo.  Tried to get dinner at the crab place but they were completely booked.  Ended up going to a random restaurant that served grilled food.  Service was slow, food was lackluster and overpriced.

Wasn't a big fan of Osaka before.  This evening made me really dislike Osaka.

**11/4 - Kurogin, Glitch, Osaka Castle, Matsusakgyu, Namba**

After a disappointing evening in Osaka, I decided to start the day with 2  things I knew would be worth a visit.

**Kurogin Tuna Store** \- arrived and stood in line before they opened.  They actually open at 9:30 and not 9:00 as stated on Google Maps.  They changed up the ordering process since my last visit.  With the new process, you select your cut of tuna from a fridge full of various cuts and sizes prepacked with prices listed and then select how you want it.  You can choose from a rice bowl, sashimi or sushi.  Torched sushi is option but not listed on the sign.  We chose a pack with a lean cut and toro for a rice bowl and chose a smaller cut of toro for torched sushi.  It came to around 10,000 yen and it was absolutely worth it.  So simple yet one of the most delicious meals I had the entire trip.  The rice was high quality, the sesame seeds were nicely toasted and the soy was slightly sweet, pairing well with the fatty tuna.  When you order a rice bowl, you also get a hefty scoop of chopped toro.  The torched toro was absolutely heavenly.  One of my favorite dishes during our last Japan trip.  The piece of tuna we purchased was cut into 4 thiccc slices allowing the cook to give it a nice sear without overcooking it.  Each bite would burst covering your tongue with delicious melted tuna fat. 10/10

**Glitch Coffee Osaka**\- We were headed towards Osaka Castle and Glitch was up north not too far away.  Location was a little harder to find because it was in the lobby of a big building.  Much larger location with more seating than the Ginza location.  They served more than customer at a time so there was little to no line.  Told the barista that  I wanted a cortado and a fruity espresso and he chose the beans for me and they were both excellent.  Wife ordered the same pour over she got at Ginza but requested it to be served cold.  We ended up spending over $100 buying beans and single serve pour over bags to bring back home. 10/10

**Osaka Castle**\- Pretty cool attraction.  We chose to walk up the 8 flights of stairs to avoid the long elevator line.  Each floor has an exhibit.  The models of the old castle layouts were neat.

**Matsusakagyu Yakiniku M Namba** \- dined here during our last trip and really enjoyed it.  I prefer Matsusaka over Kobe and Ohmi.  We ordered several cuts a la carte and sides.  They were all melt in your mouth delicious.  The sukiyaki we ordered didn't come out as a wide thin slice but a thicker 3"x 3" slice.  Was still very delicious dipped in the raw egg but not as break apart tender. The beef garlic rice was a bit soggy and not as good as last time. 8/10

**Namba** \- Very crowded with plenty of food options.  Got fried sesame mochi with a bean filling.  Hot, crispy delicious.9/10  Also got a fresh **Rikuro's Japanese cheesecake** out of the oven.  Hot, eggy and JIGGLY!  Too eggy for my tastes but my wife loves it. 7/10.  Went to **Din Tai Fung** for dinner.  This was our last meal, last time in Osaka and loved it.  Unfortunately it was not the same this time.  The dumplings weren't as savory and we actually got sick of the food half way through the meal. 7/10

**11/5 Sapporo**

Took an early flight to Sapporo.  Landed at **New Chitose** at 10:40 and checked out the airport.  There are lots of shops and restaurants at the airport.  

**Royce Chocolate World** \- a bit overhyped in my opinion.  A large Royce store with a bakery and an area where you can see them making some of the chocolates.  The bakery items are good and there is a much larger selection of Royce products than the standard airport and souvenir shops. 8/10

**Onsen Ryokan Yuen** \- at about $100 / night, it was fairly cheap but relatively expensive compared to the surrounding hotels going for \~$50.  This hotel was very nice though.  They really payed attention to small details.  The onsen was nice and relaxing.  They also offered free self serve hokkaido milk ice cream bars after an onsen visit. 9/10

**Nijo Market** \- felt very touristy here.  Not nearly as crowded as Tsukiji or markets in Osaka.  Many vendors tried to offer us discounts on dried scallops.  Had a slice of Hokkaido melon for 400 yen.  It was super juicy not sure if it was worth it.  Ended up eating kaisendon at **Donbei**.  The bowls came out quick and were cheap and delicious.  Better and cheaper than the ones we had at Tsukiji. 9/10

**Yukikaze** \-  Sapporo is known for miso ramen so we had to give it a try. Ordered ahead while waiting in line.  The broth flavor had much more depth than your regular tonkotsu and pretty heavy.  The ramen was good but I wouldn't wait more than 15 min for a bowl. 7/10

**K.L.I.M** \- Hokkaido soft cream parfaits.  The soft cream was good but the toppings masked its flavor.  Less is More.  Should have just got a soft cream cone togo. 7/10

**11/6 Breakfast, Royce Chocolate Factory, Shiki Marche, Kaniya**

We reserved breakfast at the hotel for 2800 yen /pp.  Pretty pricey for breakfast but we were served so much food and it was good.  Had sashimi, tamaji-mushi, mackerel over rice with dashi and a ton of small dishes.8/10, Tried to reserve again for next morning but they were sold out.

**Royce Chocolate Factory** \- took about an hour to get here.  Train took us to Royce's very own train station.  There a bus to take you to the factory but it was faster to just walk.  Factory was pretty neat.  You get to learn about the entire process from bean harvest to chocolate production.  The shop has every Royce product available and a bakery with savory options.  Corn pizza was terrible, Butter Corn Bread was good, Curry bread was ok, Chocolate soft cream (only available at factory) was nothing special.

**Hokkaido Shiki Marche** \- Located in Sapporo Station, shop is small but packed with the best items.  They had your standard Hokkaido souvenir snack section but the market side was what shined.  They carried many unique delicious items.  Picked up Hokkaido butters, crab and uni furikake, miso ramen kits, snacks and condiments.  They have 2 small kitchens inside serving hot items, buttercream sandwiches and the best soft cream I've had.  The texture was amazingly SOFT. 10/10 for the market, 11/10 for the soft cream

**Kaniya- Crab Feast**.  Got one of the set meals for around 12,000 yen/ pp.  It was too much food.  Had raw snow crab, boiled hairy crab, snow crab shabu shabu and a bunch of other dishes.  The porridge made with the left over shabu shabu broth was so good but took it over the top.  We were so full.

**11/7 New Chitose to Narita**

Took train from Sapporo station the airport.  We were glad we couldn't reserve breakfast bc we were still super full from last nights dinner.  I really wanted to grab a soft cream from Shiki Marche for breakfast but was too full.  Airport security there was much more lenient and efficient than TSA.  I was able to walk through with a coffee in hand.  Security just asked me to open the cup and lightly wafted it to smell it.  Ordered a melon soft cream from a random stand.  Also pointed at one of the packaged cheesecakes but employee thought I was pointing to the beer, so I had beer and ice cream for breakfast.  Stopped at the food court before our flight and tried miso corn butter ramen.  Corn was good but didn't feel like the butter improved the ramen.

Checked back into the same hotel and then picked up our storage luggage which was already pulled out and ready to go before we got there.  Wife was tired and decided to stay in.  I decided to hit up a ramen shop around the corner.

**Banninriki** \- small shop serving Abura-Soba, a dry style ramen.  Ordered a bowl with extra pork, all the extra toppings and wonton soup.  They have paper explaining how to eat it. They have a ton of condiment along the counter.  You squirt in vinegar and chili oil, and mix.  You can add topping and seasoning at any point.  Topping I got were poached egg, bamboo, nori, scallion, sprouts and I added ground fried garlic, chili powder, black pepper and ground sesame seeds.  It was good but I would have preferred more chew to the noodles. 7/10

**11/8 Nakamise-dori/ Senso-ji, Tokyo Metro Building, Full Day of EATING**

This was one of my favorite days during our trip.

**Nakamise-dori** \- got here around 9:30 and less than half of the shops were open.  Stopped at **Bairindo** bc of the long line that moved very fast.  A one man factory serving ningo-yaki, mini taiyaki in different shapes.  Its fun watching the machine pump them out and even individually wrapping them.  They were good hot and fresh.  Found shop a selling all things yuzu and stocked up.  Tried to go to **Toyofuku** for curry bread but they never opened.  Tried a menchi next door at **Asakusa Menchi** and it was incredible.  Hot, juicy and savory.  Got another one immediately after.

**Uogashi Nihon-Ichi Standing Sushi Bar** \- headed up to Shinjuku to try this.  Line moved quickly, service was fast and sushi was cheap.  You order directly with the chef and sushi comes out minutes later.  Not the best sushi but great for the price.  Offered toro, kani, kani miso, uni, ebi.  The ebi was the best I've had this trip, succulent without the sticky texture.  The kani miso and unagi were great too. 8/10

**Tokyo Metropolitan Govt Building** \- Went here since it was close by, line for elevator up was quick, line down was long and slower.  Great free views of the city.

Group split up and I had a majority of the day to myself to feast.

**Gourmet Curry Bon Gout** \- served hot beef or chicken curry bread.  Instead of the typical panko coating, they used small bread cubes resulting in a super crispy/crunchy coating.  Loved the bread/coating, filling was ok. 8/10.  They also had raw Hokkaido milk soft cream.  It had more flavor and the texture was standard.  Second favorite soft cream. 9/10

**Ramen Hosenka** \- Favorite ramen from first trip.  They make a shio kinmedai broth and serve Maximum Koitamago eggs.  Broth is super rich and flavorful yet light.  Noodles have the perfect texture.  9.5/10

**Tokyu Food Show** \- picked up more coffee at Obscura, a croissant from one of the bakeries and stocked up on dashi, soba, corn tea at the market.  Picked up a meat pie and a butter chicken curry bread from the bakery at the end of the grocery store.  Meat pie was very similar to a vietnamese pate chaud and butter chicken bread was very good.  Stopped at Pierre Herme nearby for another mille feuille.

**Seirinkan**\- dropped stuffed off and headed back out for pizza.  This place is highly rated and there is usually a line. Only 3 types of pizza and no toppings. Pizza was good and crust was well salted but I would not wait in line for this unless you were really craving pizza.  Pasta wasn't bad, perfect texture.  I was not sick of japanese food yet and would have rather ate elsewhere. 8/10

**RED/ Tokyo Tower** \- stopped here about an hour before closing and purchase the 1 hour pass for around 1200 yen.  Gives access to all the games/VR activities.  Came here mainly for the racing simulators.  Really cool if you're into cars or racing games.  Place was almost dead and had no wait for the activities I wanted to try.  Thought it would be super busy and crowded.  Great place for a group.  8/10

**11/9 Last Full Day, Shopping, Odaiba**

Seared up some wagyu for breakfast before heading to the **Okachimachi Donki** for shopping.  Walked by a vending machine selling hot cans of soup.  Tried the corn soup and it wasn't bad.  Would be great during the winter.  Really like this Donki location.  Had a good selection of products and wasn't crowded.  Bought a ton of stuff totaling \~90k yen.

Tried to get yuzu and porcini ramen at **IRUCA** for lunch but line was long and did not move.  Went over to **Afuri** instead.  Ordering was very easy with the kiosk.  Got the yuzu shio and spicy yuzu ramen.  Broth was good, regular ramen noodles were too thin for my preference and the thick noodles were too thick.   Chashu in charred on a grill.  Overall very good.  I would come back to try the tsukemen. 8/10

**Joypolis**\- Similar to RED,  Picked the regular pass and had to pay for each attraction.  Pretty much an indoor amusement park.  Played the transformers, 360 racing and tower tag.  7/10

**Trick Art Museum** \-cash only, located inside an area that was like an indoor boardwalk with souvenir shop and old games.  Employees there were very friendly and helpful.  Helped take photos for us at the optimal angle for the illusions. 8/10

**Diver City** \- stopped at **Shinshu Sojibo** bc wife wanted soba.  Food sucked. 5/10

**Kaneko Hannosuke** \- went directly here after the disappointing soba.  This was one of big culinary surprises last trip.  Everything about the tendon here is so good.  The rice is high quality and perfectly cooked.  Sauce is delicious and generous.  Tempura perfectly fried. 9/10  Theres a location at Mitsuwa Marketplace in New Jersey but its not nearly as good.

Ended night with **Cremia**, Diver City food court location offers chocolate cones

**11/10 Wishing I had 2 more weeks**

Had an evening flight but decided to head to NRT early to relax, eat and do last minute shopping.  Grabbed lunch in Terminal 1 at the restaurant with their entire menu displayed as fake food in the window.  The food was terrible.  Grabbed a takeout unagi don a few stores down bc United food is absolute garbage.  Ate it cold on the plane is it was still incredible.

&#x200B;

**Looking Back**

While planning this trip, my biggest struggle was deciding where to eat.  SO many good options and so little time.  Next time we visit, I would only do 1 fine dining meal.  They take up too much time and the reservation commitment made it more stressful.

During our first trip, I told myself I wouldn't bother returning to Osaka bc it did not offer anything Tokyo did not have.  I should have listened to myself.  I hated Osaka this time around.  Nicknamed the food capital of Japan?  But why, when the food sucks compared to Tokyo? Only went bc I panicked into buying a JR pass before the rate hike and ended up canceling it anyway.  We had a cousin tag along for her first Japan trip so we included it.  Wife also wanted to check out the Halloween event at Universal Studios but we ended up not going.  Enjoyed Nara though.

Hokkaido was a nice break in our busy schedule especially with the onsen.  Much less busy and the food was good.  We would definitely try to make it out to Ginzan Onsen on our next trip.

Was fortunate enough to go to Paris twice the past year and it was my favorite destination.  Tokyo took the crown this year.  I was able to find French food and great pastries in Tokyo.  There really isn't anything you can't find in Tokyo.

I don't much for luxury or clothes shopping but Ginza really grew on me.  Shibuya and Shinjuku were my favorite parts prior.  I really like the buildings in Ginza and its not as crowded.  Really like the shops too.

Wish I had more sushi and soft cream

Iphone SUICA was very convenient with ability to reload with AMEX.  Felt like I had unlimited money

My Food haul from the trip, should have bought more Black Thunder.  Coworkers ate them up so fast

Edit: I have pics of most, not all of the food I ate in my post history

&#x200B;

**Too Fucking Long DR - Favorite Spots**

Thanks for writing up your report. We stayed in the Umeda area in Osaka and had several places booked all in walking distance which were great (Yakitori Torisen and Yamada). Tokyo is absolutely tops vs Osaka but I enjoy its size and grittiness. It’s quite un-Japanese :)

I'm going to Japan this week and this post is super helpful. Where did you find the tsuta noodle kit in Tokyo station?

### Comment 3

Thank you so much for all the details! I have added a bunch of things to my list. My biggest fear as a foodie is that there won’t be enough room in my stomach each day to try all the things I want. Did you find this to be an issue when you were exploring and coming across great looking places?

Thanks for the detailed post! If you posted pics of your meals/snacks, I’d love the link to it.
