# After two weeks in Japan here are my tips!

Just got back from my two weeks trip to Japan. I did write up a detailed trip report so if you're interested 


[HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1bhyiio/two_weeks_march_trip_report_week_1_tokyo/) Is week 1 spent in Tokyo



[HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1bixuu4/two_weeks_march_trip_report_week_2_okinawa_kansai/) is week 2 spent in Okinawa & Kansai.


My tips for Japan:-


- **DO NOT** take the Narita express from the airport. It is the most expensive option. If at all possible get the limo bus or the Keisei Skyliner.


- **DO** the visit japan web for the custom and immigration clearance. you know that piece of paper you need to fill up at the airport? This is the digital version. In Narita there are three separate lines and the one for the QR is fully digitalized. I got in line at 5:00Pm and timed it, was done with both customs & immigration at 5:12pm. The line was empty and lightening fast, don't waste your time after a long flight and just do the QR code.


- **DO** Exchange currencies at the airport. Best rates I got with a 4 yen exchange difference for Euros while inside the city it was a 10-12 yen difference.


- **DO** Get an IC card. The type really doesn't matter just get one. In my case they were selling the Pasmo (one month) card at the same counter as the skyliner tickets so like most people I got both at the same time.


- **DO NOT** stop at a Konbini first thing. Strange thing to say I know but I noticed later that most of their stuff is over-priced. Instead stop at a Daiso for your odds & ends.


- **DO** Stop at Uniqlo or GU if you need more layers. Their heattech is a life saver and they're affordable. If Uniqlo is out of something (scarves and gloves when I visited) try GU.


- **DO NOT** underestimate transit time. If google says you need 1 hour to get somewhere then you need an 1 hour and 20 minutes to get to it. Don't try to barter with an AI that hey from here to here it was 40 minutes so it must take the same to-- NO, it'll take longer between you getting to the station, actually finding the platform and then waiting for the train. You will miss out on things because of transit time and that's ok.


- **DO** Check opening and closing times. Lots of places open late, around 12, and others close early at 5pm. Plan accordingly.


- **DO** use public transport to make your life easier. Aside from trains local buses will get you close to where you want to go. No need to walk 30 minutes to that temple when the bus station is just five minutes away from it.


- **DO NOT** spend $200 on the most comfortable pair of shoes then pair that up with a $1 pair of socks. You'll be walking 20K - 25K steps per day, get fully cushioned ones from the sports store. 


- **DO NOT** Buy the Haruka Express tickets on-site. JR has a special price for foreign visitors so check their website to get the tickets at almost half price online. Only applicable for one way tickets to or from the airport.


- **DO** put in the effort to get those hard reservations. The Ghibli Museum & Kirby Cafe were the highlight of my trip and I can't recommend them enough. Whatever you are fan of and really want to see it'll be worth it so don't listen to those that down play it, just do it. 


- **DO NOT** go to universal studios without an express pass. It's over-priced, yes. It's not necessary, no. It really is. If you can't afford an express pass... you can. yes you can, it's expensive but yes you can. Wait time for these rides are no joke, especially the thrill rides if you're an adult. I had the express pass and got herded to the normal lane at Harry Potter. Started at 10am and reached the inside of Hogwarts at 12:10... in the RAIN! The most miserable experience ever and that's just one ride. Some wait times stretch out to three hours. You are there for one day, cough up the money.


- **Do** try local restaurants and cafes. unlike chains that are aimed at foreigners local haunts depend on fresh ingredients and little side dishes to add variety to your meal. The difference is massive and they're often a lot cheaper too!   


- **DO NOT** bother with the dessert at chains. Specially chains like Starbucks & conveyer belt sushi. While the coffee and sushi are fine the dessert is the worst I've tasted throughout the trip. Just horrible. 


- **DO** not follow the bus advice in Kyoto... the bus system there is... something else. Seriously rent a bic or walk, it'll probably be faster and more comfortable.


- **DO NOT** commit too fast when shopping. Especially when it's something without a fixed price like figures in Akihabara. I found a figure for 6000 yen in one store, used & without a box. Just to see it for 2500 new and unopened literally across the street. Same with the Pokemon center where I found the same plushies for 30% off in Akihabara. 


- **DO** Have fun. The best days of my trip were simply me walking in a park or having a picnic under an early blooming sakura tree. It's your trip, no need to do this or that, just have fun and enjoy yourself.

> DO NOT take the Narita express from the airport. It is the most expensive option. If at all possible get the limo bus or the Keisei Skyliner.

Not sure I understand where this is coming from? This is the sort of thing that doesn't have a clear DO or DO NOT recommendation, because it obviously depends on where you're going. 

The Airport Limousine fare from Narita to Shibuya for instance is 3,600JPY and a walk-up NEX One-Way is 3,250JPY. The NEX is not only cheaper but also easily about 30-45 minutes quicker than the limo bus, and NEX runs throughout the day. A NEX Round-Trip for tourists is even cheaper at  5,000JPY.

I made the mistake last time of taking the Keisei Skyliner to the Yamanote Line to get to Shibuya instead of waiting for the next NEX departure to go direct to Shibuya. I then got caught up in the evening rush on the Yamanote all out of a desire the leave the airport quickly and save a few Yen. I should just have waited for the NEX and gone direct to Shibuya.

Where were you trying to go in Kyoto? I'm not denying your experience, but I can only think of very few situations where walking is faster than taking the bus there, even if its bus system is not as great as Tokyo or Osaka's. Kyoto is big and the sights are spread out!

### Comment 2

Disagree heavily on ATM part, SoftBank (7-11?) offer great rates if you have a no fx fee credit card. And disagree on not visiting a konbini , itâ€™s a place for food, daiso is mostly for house products so why compare both? Lol ðŸ˜‚

### Comment 3

Chains are not made for foreigners lmao. Where do people get these ideas from?

### Comment 4

I'm surprised about the currency exchange... getting better rates in airport?

### Comment 5

Take the NEX for sure! Value for money and your time
