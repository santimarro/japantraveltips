# Is 2,000 US dollars enough for spending money for 8 nights in Japan?

$2,000 would be for spending money only. Not including lodging. This would be for transportation, food, entertainment.

### Comment 1

$250 usd a day is a lot!  It depends on what kind of entertainment food and if your transport will be all taxis or shinkansen trains etc.    I budgeted $100 a day and did/ate everything I wanted to without thinking about it, including shopping, and spent less than that.

### Comment 2

For “normal” spending, that’s beyond plenty. 

If you’re going to omakase dinners every other night and doing lots of Shinkansen travel, then you may want more spending money.

### Comment 3

The real answer is “it depends on a lot of factors not written here”. 

What kind of transportation? What kind of food? What kind of entertainment? What part of Japan?

If you are in Tokyo going to concerts and amusement parks, buying souvenirs for you and people important to you, eating nice steak or sushi every night it may not be enough. If you are in Kyushu just piddling around the local train and eating ramen, it’s plenty.

Most likely you are somewhere in between. So whether it’s enough or not depends on what you are doing to do. Or, conversely - what you can do is constrained by the fact that this is your budget.

### Comment 4

That’s plenty for two weeks.

### Comment 5

Absolutely. The yen is awful right now. I spent way less in Japan for 10 days than I typically do in my day to day life.
