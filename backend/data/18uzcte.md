# I managed to get kichi kichi omurice reservations

Hey all,   
Barring your opinion of the place, I managed to get reservations today for kichi kichi. If you're trying, here are some tips:    
    
1. Already know ahead of time the day, people, and time you want to go. You're racing for 8 seats at the counter. Anywhere else you'll need to walk in.   
2. From what I could tell, it's only weekends that were open. Maybe there was other days, but I was dead set on a weekend night.   
3.  the reservations open at 11am JST on a Sunday for four weeks ahead. Fifteen minutes before, my computer is setup with multiple browsers that were ready to refresh (I had Firefox and Edge open). Browsers were already at the calendar page showing what's open or out of reservation.   
4. Promptly at 11am, I refreshed every browser open (CTRL+F5). You'll know because the browser will hang for a bit before loading.      
5. If there is availability, it will show the number of open seats. click on that immediately. After this, you gotta be fast!   
6. The next page is a confirmation time. There's two times: lunch and dinner. note there is only one seating for each service, so don't think about it and know before hand when you want to go.  
7. On the next page, fill out your information: number of guests, name, email, phone, and occasion.   
8. if the reservation is successful, you'll get a confirmation email immediately.  
    
    
Notes:    
The reservations filled within a minute. The more people, the faster you need to be.    
Recommend not trying it on your phone. My partner tried it and couldn't type fast enough.    
Reminder you're going for dinner and a show. Omurice is everywhere and I bet there's better places than kichi kichi. Last time I went to Japan I think I got omurice in a train station restaurant and it was, in my opinion, pretty good; I just didn't get a hyper chef hyping it up.   
    
Good luck to all.

To anyone that didn’t get in you didn’t miss much. I had better omurice in Tokyo. It was definitely a good show but nothing I’d really recommend hunting down like Ghibli tickets.

### Comment 2

It's just mid omurice...

Treat it like a Disney attraction instead.

I went a couple months ago and agree with the general consensus here. A fine enough meal; a bit bitter maybe (such is the nature of demiglace sauce) but the staff and the chef are so fun to watch. They do very much lean on the social media aspect though; they even provide cell phone stands for videos. They know what brings the people in.

If it's a good meal in Kyoto that needs booking you're looking for, i strongly suggest the [Teppan Tavern Tenamonya.](https://www.tenamonyakyoto.com/english)

Thanks for the informative post but I couldn’t imagine going through all this trouble to spend $20 on a mid omurice. There are so many amazing restaurants in Kyoto to try out instead of wasting a meal here

You can also get on the day appointments too but you have to line up. You can start writing your name down at 3pm but the line starts way earlier. I was there at 1:45pm to check it out and there were already like 5 people on line waiting already. If I didn’t get there early I don’t think I would have gotten a reservation at all. So yes, I did wait like 1.25 hours 

There are only 8 seats at the counter and a table in the back. There are time slots that start at 5 or 6pm I believe and you can select the slot for that day. Some people reserve for 8 people on the line too — so the line you see is not accurate, each person might be booking a group.
