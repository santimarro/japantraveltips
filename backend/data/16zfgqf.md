# What NOT to buy in Japan?

Got inspired by a post about ‚Äúwhat to buy‚Äù and thought of asking you all the opposite question. 

I‚Äôll start: fruit. It‚Äôs so much cheaper to get  grapes and apples at home

### Comment 1

I wouldn‚Äôt buy fruit as a souvenir but I am still buying fruit in Japan when I want to eat it üßê Such a staple in my diet

### Comment 2

Don't get talked into buying 2 bags of **dried prunes** by a random street vendor in Kyoto. No matter how convincing he is.

You will NEVER finish it in your trip. And by the end of the holiday, you're going to decide whether to bring them home because you've paid way too much for them.. and they taste kinda nice despite you've gotten tired of eating them daily. Those reasons to keep them were all moot points, you are going to end up throwing them away anyway because they made your luggage stink.

Not me, just a thought.

Lol everyone in here only complaining about their fruit comment. Why not come up with an answer while you‚Äôre at it? My answer would be maybe some kinds of vintage games. Nintendo for example has some physical & software regional locks on their consoles/games. So it would suck to get home and realize you can‚Äôt play Japanese Mario Party 3 on your North American N64 without an adapter. Fun fact though, the Gameboys up to the DS Lite are not region locked, so get those if you‚Äôre in to that kind of thing!

Hard agree with the Crane Game comment. By all means, throw a few yen at a small one for the fun of it, but if you actually like the object,  I‚Äôve seen most of the figure models, bags, etc in shops where you can buy them outright and I bet they come out much cheaper than through the crane game!!

1. If you‚Äôre coming from Europe, think twice before buying laptops. They may be cheaper, but:
I) Unlikely to find a non-JP keyboard 
II) You don‚Äôt get the mandatory 2 year warranty 

2. I‚Äôve heard that some cameras only come with Japanese menus installed, so need to watch out for that too. 

3. Phones: Japanese phones have a camera shutter sound that cannot be disabled.
